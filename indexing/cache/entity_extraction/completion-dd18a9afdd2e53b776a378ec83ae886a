We have observed that righting is achieved solely by performing a rolling manoeuvre. How flies manage to do this has not yet been elucidated. It was observed here for the first time that hoverfly reorientation is entirely achieved within 6 wingbeats (48.8\u201a\u00c4\u00d6ms) at angular roll velocities of up to 10\u221a\u00f3103 deg s\u201a\u00e0\u00ed1 and that the onset of their head rotation consistently follows that of their body rotation after a time lag of 16\u201a\u00c4\u00d6ms. The insects' body roll was found to be triggered by the asymmetric wing stroke amplitude, as expected. The righting process starts immediately with the first wingbeat and seems unlikely to depend on visual feedback. A dynamic model for the fly's righting reflex is presented, which accounts for the head/body movements and the time lag recorded in these experiments. This model consists of a closed-loop control of the body roll, combined with a feedforward control of the head/body angle. During the righting manoeuvre, a strong coupling seems to exist between the activation of the halteres (which measure the body's angular speed) and the gaze stabilization reflex. These findings again confirm the fundamental role played by the halteres in both body and head stabilization processes. Summary: Hoverfly righting is achieved by performing a rolling manoeuvre; reorientation is achieved within 6 wingbeats and hoverfly head rotation follows that of their body after a time lag of 16\u201a\u00c4\u00d6ms.\",TRUE\nHow do plants \u201a\u00c4\u00fanotice\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 attack by herbivorous arthropods?,\"Precise and deep comprehension of plant responses to herbivorous arthropods requires detailed knowledge of how a plant \u201a\u00c4\u00fanotices\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 the attack.
