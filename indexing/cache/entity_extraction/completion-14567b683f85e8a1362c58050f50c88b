Interaction with the positively charged face of calcium-oxalate monohydrate leads to formation of a peptide film, but the slow adsorption kinetics and gradual relaxation to a well-bound state result in time-dependent effects. These include a positive feedback between peptide adsorption and step inhibition described by a mathematical catastrophe that results in growth hysteresis, characterized by rapid switching from fast to near-zero growth rates for very small reductions in supersaturation. Interactions with the negatively charged face result in formation of peptide clusters that impede step advancement. The result is a competition between accelerated solute attachment and inhibition due to blocking of the steps by the clusters. The findings have implications for control of pathological mineralization and suggest artificial strategies for directing crystallization.\",TRUE\nSuper black and ultrathin amorphous carbon film inspired by anti-reflection architecture in butterfly wing,Abstract An ultrathin and super black amorphous carbon (a-C) film has been fabricated by borrowing the inverse V-type anti-reflection nano-architecture from the black wings of butterfly Ornithoptera goliath through vacuum sintering process. The biomimetic a-C film shows good optical absorption (99%) at low reflectance (,TRUE\n\"Super-lampreys and wave energy: Optimised control of artificially-evolved, simulated swimming lamprey\",\"Propulsion in the lamprey, an eel-like fish, is governed by activity in its spinal neural network (called a central pattern generator (CPG)). This CPG is simulated, in accordance with Ekeberg's original model, and optimised alternatives are generated with genetic algorithms (GAs). A two-phase GA is adopted: (1) to evolve neuron-descriptive parameters and synaptic weights of the neural oscillator for a single lamprey segment, (2) to generate interconnections between segments. Results demonstrate that Ekeberg's prototype is not a unique solution and that simpler versions with wider operational ranges can be generated. Evolved solutions outperform the swimming capabilities of a modelled biological organism, as an initial step in understanding how to control wave power devices, with similar motion to the lamprey.\",TRUE\nSupercontraction forces in spider dragline silk depend on hydration rate.,\"Spider dragline silk is a model biological polymer for biomimetic research due to its many desirable and unusual\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "phi3:latest", "temperature": 0.5, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 8192, "n": null}}
