Cluster analysis, multidimensional scaling, and classification trees were used with these profiles to quantify similarity among individual gaps. Gaps fell into four groups, which could be interpreted as three ecologically functional groups on the basis of their role in stand development. Gaps caused by the same agents commonly fell within the same functional group: (1) flooding, logging, spruce budworm, and windfall cause stand level impacts that reset the stand development sequence; (2) bark beetles, tree fall, and root diseases cause within stand impacts that altered the rate of stand development; and (3) stem decay and dwarf mistletoe, and, under some circumstances, all disturbance agents, could kill trees yet have no impact on stand development except create space into which neighboring trees expand. We present a simple test to monitor how gaps change with silvicultural manipulations. Results indicate that this method offers (1) a way to systematically guide silvicultural manipulations aimed at mimicking natural disturbances at the canopy gap scale, and (2) a way to monitor the effectiveness of such silvicultural treatments and management actions using gap-based silviculture prescriptions.\"\nMAINTAIN_BIODIVERSITY,\"Why tree-crop interactions in agroforestry appear at odds with tree-grass interactions in tropical savannahs This paper describes recent research findings on resource sharing between trees and crops in the semiarid tropics and attempts to reconcile this information with current knowledge of the interactions between savannah trees and understorey vegetation by examining agroforestry systems from the perspective of succession. In general, productivity of natural vegetation under savannah trees increases as rainfall decreases, while the opposite occurs in agroforestry. One explanation is that in the savannah, the beneficial effects of microclimatic improvements (e.g. lower temperatures and evaporation losses) are greater in more xeric environments. Mature savannah trees have a high proportion of woody above-ground structure compared to foliage, so that the amount of water 'saved' (largely by reduction in soil evaporation) is greater than water 'lost' through transpiration by trees. By contrast, in agroforestry practices such as alley cropping where tree density is high, any beneficial effects of the trees on microclimate are negated by reductions in soil moisture due to increasing interception losses and tree transpiration. While investment in woody structure can improve the water economy beneath agrofore\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "phi3:latest", "temperature": 0.5, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 8192, "n": null}}
