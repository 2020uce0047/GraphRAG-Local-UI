Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Because of this, this methodology section outlines the steps in the research process. The reasoning behind each step and how these relate to the research aims is discussed concurrently, rather than being separated into discrete sections.\n\n2.2.1. Step One: Literature and Design Precedent Review\n\nThe theoretical framework for the diagram is based on the ecosystem services relationship diagrams and the urban ecosystem services categories described by Pedersen Zari [22]. This work established the initial 22 ecosystem services and 49 subcategories of ecosystem services that were investigated and mapped (see Table 1). A critical literature and design precedent review of existing and developing strategies and technologies that enable the creation of ecosystem services through the medium of building materials and components, whole buildings, built infrastructure, and urban spaces was conducted. This was combined with and compared to international databases of urban nature-based solutions that focus on climate change adaptation or climate change mitigation [56\u201360].\n\nFor every strategy, concept, or technology identified, one or more illustrative built case studies were investigated and summarized. Case studies (114 in total) include: architecture, landscape architecture, urban design, infrastructure design, building technologies/components/materials, and a number of urban development policies.\n\nIt should be noted that cultural ecosystem services are benefits that humans obtain from ecosystems related specifically to psychological, cultural, and societal wellbeing. This ecosystem services type has been well investigated in social sciences literature, and socio-ecological models that link cultural services with ecological functions already exist [61]. Due to the existence of such models, the \u2018strategies for designing urban ecosystem services diagram\u2019 currently focuses on design strategies, concepts, and technologies for provisioning, regulating, and supporting ecosystem services. Architects and designers are trained to integrate cultural and aesthetic aspects into their design work already and typically are expert at this. This means mapping design strategies that produce cultural ecosystem services is both a large task, but crucially is less urgent in relation to improving the ecological performance of urban environments. Future work is planned that integrates and relates cultural services to existing elements in the \u2018strategies for designing urban ecosystem services diagram\u2019.\n\n2.2.2. Step Two: Relational Database Compilation\n\nThe results of step one were compiled into a database that identified relationships between design strategies, concepts, and technologies, and specific ecosystem services. Case studies were also added to the database. The database was developed in the Microsoft Excel program (Microsoft Office Professional Plus\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "sciphi/triplex:latest", "temperature": 0.5, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 1024, "n": null}}
