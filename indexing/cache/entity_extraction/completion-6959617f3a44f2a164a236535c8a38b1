{"result": " The first step in setting up a new aquarium is to choose the appropriate size tank for your space and budget, considering that larger tanks generally offer greater stability for maintaining water parameters. Next, you'll want to acquire the necessary equipment including a filtration system, heater (if housing tropical fish), lighting, substrate, and decorations like rocks or plants. Once acquired, ensure all items are properly installed following the manufacturer's guidelines. After setting up these basics, it is crucial to let the tank cycle without fish for at least four weeks before introducing any aquatic life. This allows beneficial bacteria to establish and stabilize the ecosystem within your tank.\n\nNext, test the water parameters like pH, ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels using an aquarium testing kit to ensure a safe environment for fish. Only after achieving stable readings can you safely introduce fish, starting with hardier species before adding more sensitive ones over time. Remember to research specific care requirements for the species you plan to keep.\n\n{Assistant}", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

The peak power output is 36 mW or 0.45 W.g-1. The peak isometric force is attained when the tibia is fully flexed and the force falls as the tibia extends. The extensor tibiae muscle A band is 5.5 mum long and the peak force is over 0.75 N.m-2. The peak velocity of shortening is 7 mm.sec-1 or about 1.75 lengths/sec at 30 degrees C. The tensile strength of the extensor apodeme is 0.6 kN.mm-2 and Young's modulus is 19 kN.mm-2. The safety factor does not exceed 1.2 and the safety factor of the semilunar processes and tibial cuticle is little higher. The jump impulse lasts 25-30 msec. A velocity of 3.2 m.sec-1 is reached after a peak acceleration of 180 m.sec-2. The peak power output is 0.75 W at close to maximum velocity. Energy losses in rotating the femur and tibia are small and it is shown that the leg is able to extend at 7 times the normal rate with losses of about 20%. Most of the stored energy is converted to kinetic energy as the animal jumps. A model is based on the relaxation of a spring that has the properties of the elastic elements of the locust leg into a lever with the same kinematics as the locust leg produces a force-distance curve similar to that measured for locust jumps. The major part of the jump energy is stored before the jump.\",TRUE\nThe evolution of sweat glands,\"Mammals have two kinds of sweat glands, apocrine and eccrine, which provide for thermal cooling. In this paper we describe the distribution and characteristics of these glands in selected mammals, especially primates, and reject the suggested development of the eccrine gland from the apocrine gland during the Tertiary geological period. The evidence strongly suggests that the two glands, depending on the presence or absence of fur, have equal and similar functions among mammals; apocrine glands are not primitive. However, there is a unique and remarkable thermal eccrine system in humans; we suggest that this system evolved in concert with bipedalism and a smooth hairless skin.\",TRUE\nThe eyes of oil\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "phi3:latest", "temperature": 0.5, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 8192, "n": null}}
