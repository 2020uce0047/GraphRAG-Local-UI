{"result": " To find a nearby library, you can use several resources depending on the region or country you are in. Here's a general guide to help you locate one:\n\n1. **Use Online Maps**: Google Maps is a widely accessible tool that provides location-based services such as finding libraries near your area. Simply type \"libraries near me\" into the search bar, and it will show nearby library locations along with their addresses. You can also check if there are any special filters for public or academic institutions to refine your results.\n   \n2. **Local Government Websites**: Many local governments have listings of public libraries on their official websites under community services or resources sections. This can help you find libraries in your municipality, county, or region. \n\n3. **Library Systems and Consortia**: In some areas, multiple libraries might be part of a larger network that shares resources. Exploring the website of such library systems will give you information about all the member institutions in the area.\n\n4. **Mobile Apps**: There are specific apps for finding books or accessing digital libraries where you can search by location; some popular ones include Goodreads and Libby. These apps sometimes also have physical branches listed with locations, like OverDrive which partners with public libraries to provide ebooks and audiobooks.\n\n5. **Ask on Social Media**: You might find community groups or forums dedicated to your area that can give recommendations based on their experiences of local libraries.\n\n6. **Contact Local Libraries Directly**: If you know a library near you, ask them about other branches in the region and any resources they could share with patrons looking to locate more libraries.\n\n7. **Local Newspapers or Magazines**: These sometimes feature articles on new community services like local library openings which can help direct you to nearby institutions.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

The organization of iridophores into two superposed layers constitutes an evolutionary novelty for chameleons, which allows some species to combine efficient camouflage with spectacular display, while potentially providing passive thermal protection.\",TRUE\nPhotoprotection of green plants: a mechanism of ultra-fast thermal energy dissipation in desiccated lichens,\"In order to survive sunlight in the absence of water, desiccation-tolerant green plants need to be protected against photooxidation. During drying of the chlorolichen Cladonia rangiformis and the cyanolichen Peltigera neckeri, chlorophyll fluorescence decreased and stable light-dependent charge separation in reaction centers of the photosynthetic apparatus was lost. The presence of light during desiccation increased loss of fluorescence in the chlorolichen more than that in the cyanolichen. Heating of desiccated Cladonia thalli, but not of Peltigera thalli, increased fluorescence emission more after the lichen had been dried in the light than after drying in darkness. Activation of zeaxanthin-dependent energy dissipation by protonation of the PsbS protein of thylakoid membranes was not responsible for the increased loss of chlorophyll fluorescence by the chlorolichen during drying in the light. Glutaraldehyde inhibited loss of chlorophyll fluorescence during drying. Desiccation-induced loss of chlorophyll fluorescence and of light-dependent charge separation are interpreted to indicate activation of a highly effective mechanism of photoprotection in the lichens. Activation is based on desiccation-induced conformational changes of a pigment\u201a\u00c4\u00ecprotein complex. Absorbed light energy is converted into heat within a picosecond or femtosecond time domain. When present during desiccation, light interacts with the structural changes of the protein providing increased photoprotection. Energy dissipation is inactivated and structural changes are reversed when water becomes available again. Reversibility of ultra-fast thermal dissipation of light energy avoids photo-damage in the absence of water and facilitates the use of light for photosynthesis almost as soon as water becomes available.\",TRUE\nPhotosynthetic adaptation of two semi-arid species of Gethyllis (Kukumakranka) to drought-and-shade stress,\"Abstract Gethyllis multifolia and Gethyllis villosa are winter-growing, summer-blooming, deciduous and bulbous geophytes\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "phi3:latest", "temperature": 0.5, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 8192, "n": null}}
