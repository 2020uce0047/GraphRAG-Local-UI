Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected.

The teeth can be subdivided into a cusp, a junctional area where the cusp is joined to the base, and the base which is embedded in the radular membrane. From a study of longitudinal vertical and transverse sections of the mature teeth it was found that the cusp could be subdivided into a posterior iron-rich area (44\u201a\u00c4\u00ec51% Fe, 1\u201a\u00c4\u00ec6% Si) and an anterior silicon-rich area (22\u201a\u00c4\u00ec30% Fe, 27\u201a\u00c4\u00ec32% Si). The junctional zone consisted of a poorly mineralised layer at its border with the cusp and an iron-rich layer where it joined the base. The upper part of the base (5% Fe, 16% Si) could be clearly differentiated from the silicon-rich anterior and lower parts of the base (3\u201a\u00c4\u00ec4% Fe, 28\u201a\u00c4\u00ec35% Si). No minerals were detected in the membrane. The changes in the mineral content of the teeth cusps along the length of the radula were studied. Iron appeared in the cusps at the 25th row and the concentration increased to 28% at the 50th row. The iron was here evenly distributed throughout the cusp. Silicon appeared in the anterior part of the cusp at the 50th row and as it increased in concentration so the iron was displaced, and at the same time the concentration of iron increased in the posterior part of the cusp. Mineralization appeared to be complete by the 150th row.The teeth cusps appear to consist of 800 \u221a\u00d6 fibres grouped into 1\u0152\u00ba thick bundles and the tooth appears to be covered by a thin enamel-like layer. It is suggested that the fibres contain the silicon-rich phase and the matrix the iron-rich phase.The significance of the arrangement of the fibres and the distribution of the minerals are discussed with relation to the function of the teeth.\",TRUE\nThe Molecular Basis of Nacre Formation,\"A protein complex guides the process of nacre formation in mollusk shells. The mechanisms that determine the structural features of organisms are complex, and we are still far from predicting the structure of an organism by looking at its genetic makeup. An additional level of complexity exists for organisms that form body parts composed of mineralized structures such as sea shells, bone, and teeth. These organisms must also carefully control the interfaces between the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "sciphi/triplex:latest", "temperature": 0.5, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 1024, "n": null}}
