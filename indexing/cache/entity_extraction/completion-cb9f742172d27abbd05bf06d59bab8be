This finding constitutes another example of the sophisticated control mechanisms used in self-organized ant colonies.\"\nCOORDINATE_BY_SELF-ORGANIZATION|SEND_CHEMICAL_SIGNALS|SENSE_CHEMICALS|RESPOND_TO_SIGNALS,\"Quorum sensing and social networking in the microbial world For many years, bacterial cells were considered primarily as selfish individuals, but, in recent years, it has become evident that, far from operating in isolation, they coordinate collective behaviour in response to environmental challenges using sophisticated intercellular communication networks. Cell-to-cell communication between bacteria is mediated by small diffusible signal molecules that trigger changes in gene expression in response to fluctuations in population density. This process, generally referred to as quorum sensing (QS), controls diverse phenotypes in numerous Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Recent advances have revealed that bacteria are not limited to communication within their own species but are capable of \u201a\u00c4\u00f2listening in\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 and \u201a\u00c4\u00f2broadcasting to\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 unrelated species to intercept messages and coerce cohabitants into behavioural modifications, either for the good of the population or for the benefit of one species over another. It is also evident that QS is not limited to the bacterial kingdom. The study of two-way intercellular signalling networks between bacteria and both uni- and multicellular eukaryotes as well as between eukaryotes is just beginning to unveil a rich diversity of communication pathways.\"\nCOORDINATE_BY_SELF-ORGANIZATION|SENSE_TOUCH_AND_MECHANICAL_FORCES,\"Serotonin mediates behavioral gregarization underlying swarm formation in desert locusts Desert locusts, Schistocerca gregaria, show extreme phenotypic plasticity, transforming between a little-seen solitarious phase and the notorious swarming gregarious phase depending on population density. An essential tipping point in the process of swarm formation is the initial switch from strong mutual aversion in solitarious locusts to coherent group formation and greater activity in gregarious locusts. We show here that serotonin, an evolutionarily conserved mediator of neuronal plasticity, is responsible for this behavioral transformation, being both necessary if behavioral gregarization is to occur and sufficient to induce it. Our data demonstrate a neurochemical mechanism linking interactions between individuals to large-scale changes in population structure and the onset of mass migration.\"\nRESPOND_TO_SIGNALS,\"Mechanisms of membrane fusion: disparate players and common principles Membrane fusion can\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "phi3:latest", "temperature": 0.5, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 8192, "n": null}}
