{"result": " As a language model assistant, I understand that you might need guidance on how to structure a research paper. Here are the essential parts of a standard research paper format:\n\n1. Title: A concise statement that gives an overview of your work. It should be specific and descriptive enough for readers to get a sense of what your study is about.\n   \n2. Abstract: This section provides a summary of the main points covered in the paper, typically between 150-250 words long. It covers the research question, methodology, results, and conclusions.\n\n3. Introduction: Introduce your topic by stating the problem statement or area that needs exploration, presenting the research objectives and providing an overview of what the reader can expect from reading the paper. You may also include a brief review of existing literature related to the subject matter here.\n   \n4. Methodology: Describe the methods you used for your study. This section should detail everything about how you conducted your research, including data sources and analysis techniques. It must be detailed enough that someone could repeat your work using this description. \n   \n5. Results: Discuss what you discovered during the course of your research, including any charts or graphs as visual aids for your findings. \n    \n6. Discussion/Analysis: Analyze your results in this section by linking them to the hypothesis and explaining their implications. Include any limitations encountered.\n   \n7. Conclusion: Summarize key findings, how they fit within existing literature or theory, and suggest areas for future research. \n    \n8. References/Bibliography: Cite all works you have referred to in the paper using an accepted citation style like APA, MLA, or Chicago, among others. This should include books, articles, and websites used throughout your study.\n   \n9. Appendices (if necessary): Provide any additional information that supports your research but isn't directly related to the core content of your paper. \n\nRemember to always proofread and edit for clarity, grammar, and punctuation before submission.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Geometric morphometric data were used to transform an existing finite element shell model into a series of models corresponding to the shapes of individual turtles. Models were assigned identical material properties and loaded under identical conditions, and the stresses produced by a series of eight loads were extracted to describe the strength of the shells. \u201a\u00c4\u00faLotic\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 shell shapes produced significantly higher stresses than \u201a\u00c4\u00falentic\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 shell shapes, indicating that the former is weaker than the latter. Females had significantly stronger shell shapes than males, although these differences were less consistent than differences between flow regimes. We conclude that, despite the potential for many\u201a\u00c4\u00eato\u201a\u00c4\u00eaone mapping of shell shape onto strength, P. concinna experiences a trade\u201a\u00c4\u00eaoff in shell shape between hydrodynamic and mechanical performance. This trade\u201a\u00c4\u00eaoff may be evident in many other turtle species or any other aquatic species that also depend on a shell for defense. However, evolution of body size may provide an avenue of escape from this trade\u201a\u00c4\u00eaoff in some cases, as changes in size can drastically affect mechanical performance while having little effect on hydrodynamic performance.

BC is an important component of the global carbon cycle because, compared to unburned biogenic OC, it is selectively conserved in terrestrial and oceanic pools. Here we show that the dissolved BC (DBC) content of dissolved OC (DOC) is twice greater in major (sub)tropical and high-latitude rivers than in major temperate rivers, with further significant differences between biomes. We estimate that rivers export 18\u201a\u00c4\u00e2\u00ac\u00b1\u201a\u00c4\u00e24 Tg DBC year \u201a\u00e0\u00ed1 globally and that, including particulate BC fluxes, total riverine export amounts to 43\u201a\u00c4\u00e2\u00ac\u00b1\u201a\u00c4\u00e215 Tg BC year \u201a\u00e0\u00ed1 (12\u201a\u00c4\u00e2\u00ac\u00b1\u201a\u00c4\u00e25% of the OC flux).
