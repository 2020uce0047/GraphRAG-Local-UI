Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

The phenol-containing epicuticle stains deep brown only where the protective layer of wax has been removed.Although the epicuticle shows no visible injury as the result of abrasion, the underlying cells react as though they had been wounded, and growth processes in the epidermis are affected.Insect larvae from the soil show great but variable evaporation of water. This is the result of abrasion of the cuticle by soil particles. If the wireworm Agriotes is allowed to moult out of contact with the soil it has an impermeable cuticle like other insects.After abrasion the living insect is able to secrete more wax through the substance of the cuticle and so to restore its impermeability. Adsorption of the wax by dusts while it is being secreted interferes with this process of recovery.Lipoid solvents remove the wax layer from the surface and so increase transpiration. A long series of wetting agents and detergents has been tested. They show widely different effects on permeability of the cuticle to water.Removal of the wax layer by means of abrasive dusts or suitable detergents increases the rate of entry of insecticides through the cuticle.\",TRUE\n\"Traps of carnivorous pitcher plants as a habitat: composition of the fluid, biodiversity and mutualistic activities.\",\"BACKGROUNDCarnivorous pitcher plants (CPPs) use cone-shaped leaves to trap animals for nutrient supply but are not able to kill all intruders of their traps. Numerous species, ranging from bacteria to vertrebrates, survive and propagate in the otherwise deadly traps. This paper reviews the literature on phytotelmata of CPPs.PITCHERFluid as a Habitat The volumes of pitchers range from 0\u00ac\u22112 mL to 1\u00ac\u22115 L. In Nepenthes and Cephalotus, the fluid is secreted by the trap; the other genera collect rain water. The fluid is usually acidic, rich in O(2) and contains digestive enzymes. In some taxa, toxins or detergents are found, or the fluid is extremely viscous. In Heliamphora or Sarracenia, the fluid differs little from pure water.INQUILINEDiversity Pitcher inquilines comprise bacteria, protozoa, algae, fungi, rotifers, crustaceans, arachnids, insects and amphibia. The dominant groups are protists\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "phi3:latest", "temperature": 0.5, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 8192, "n": null}}
