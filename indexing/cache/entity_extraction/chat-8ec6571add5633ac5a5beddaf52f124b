Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [Desert, Lark, Skin, Ceramide, Free fatty acid, Water vapor, Beetle, Mountain pine beetle, Bone, Piezoelectric scaffold, Shark, Wood frog, Mycosporine-like amino acid, Termite, Mound]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in Here's a simplified summary of each text in plain language:\n\n1. **Bird Skin Lipids Adaptation to Desert Environments**\n   - Larks living in hot, dry deserts have less water loss from their skin compared to those in more humid environments.\n   - Instead of having more lipids in their skin (stratum corneum), desert larks have a higher proportion of certain ceramides and fewer free fatty acids. This makes the lipid layers more ordered and creates a tighter barrier against water vapor diffusion, reducing water loss.\n\n2. **Mountain Pine Beetle Flight and Host Colonization**\n   - Female mountain pine beetles that fly longer distances and lose more body mass during flight are less likely to colonize new hosts (trees) but produce more aggregation pheromone.\n   - Male beetles' production of attraction pheromone is affected by their condition after flying, not the energy used during flight.\n   - This variation in flight behavior helps maintain population levels by balancing safe and risky host colonization strategies.\n\n3. **Piezoelectric Scaffold for Adaptive Bone Tissue Engineering**\n   - A new material system is developed that can adapt its mechanical properties in response to external stress.\n   - Piezoelectric scaffolds generate charges when stressed, which induce mineralization from surrounding media, reinforcing regions of high stress or damaged areas.\n   - This self-regenerating material could help address challenges in load-bearing applications by adapting to changing stress conditions.\n\n4. **Daily Variation of UV-Protective Compounds in Marine Dinoflagellate**\n   - The marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae increases its production of UV-absorbing compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids) when exposed to high photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) or PAR plus ultraviolet radiation (UVR).\n   - These compounds help protect the dinoflagellate from UV damage.\n\n5. **Termite Mounds as Passive Ventilation Systems**\n   - Termite mounds in different environments use periodic solar heating to drive internal ventilation, functioning like an external lung for the colony.\n   - Despite differences in gas stratification and overturning patterns, termite architectures can harness solar energy to facilitate gas exchange, with implications for human engineering. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

Because of this stiff coupling, forces acting on the hairs can be transmitted to the shaft and thus to the auditory sensory organ at the base of the flagellum, a process that is proposed to improve acoustic sensitivity. Indeed, the mechanical sensitivity of the male antenna not only exceeds the sensitivity of the female antenna but also those of all other arthropod movement receivers studied so far.\"\nSENSE_SOUND/VIBRATIONS,\"Hyperacute directional hearing in a microscale auditory system The physics of sound propagation imposes fundamental constraints on sound localization: for a given frequency, the smaller the receiver, the smaller the available cues. Thus, the creation of nanoscale acoustic microphones with directional sensitivity is very difficult.

The main component, 9-ODA, acts as a releaser pheromone by attracting workers to the queen and as a primer pheromone by physiologically inhibiting worker ovary development; it also acts as a sex pheromone, attracting drones during mating flights. However, the extent to which social and sexual chemical messages are shared remains unresolved. By using a custom chemosensory-specific microarray and qPCR, we identified four candidate sex pheromone Ors (AmOr10, -11, -18, and -170) from the honey bee genome based on their biased expression in drone antennae. We assayed the pheromone responsiveness of these receptors by using Xenopus oocytes and electrophysiology. AmOr11 responded specifically to 9-ODA (EC50 = 280 \u00ac\u00b1 31 nM) and not to any of the other seven QRP components, other social pheromones, or floral odors. We did not observe any responses of the other three Ors to any of the eight QRP pheromone components, suggesting 9-ODA is the only QRP component that also acts as a long-distance sex pheromone.\",TRUE\n\"A lightweight, biological structure with tailored stiffness: The feather vane.\",\"UNLABELLEDThe flying feathers of birds are keratinous appendages designed for maximum performance with a minimum weight penalty. Thus, their design contains ingenious combinations of components that optimize lift, stiffness, aerodynamics, and damage resistance. This design involves two main parts: a central shaft that prescribes stiffness and lateral vanes which allows for the capture of air. Within the feather vane, barbs branch from the shaft and barbules branch from barbs, forming a flat surface which ensures lift. Microhooks at the end of barbules hold barbs tightly together, providing the close-knit, unified structure of the feather vane and enabling a repair of the structure through the reattachment of un-hooked junctions. Both the shaft and barbs are lightweight biological structures constructed of keratin using the common motif of a solid shell and cellular interior. The cellular core increases the resistance to buckling with little added weight. Here we analyze the detailed structure of the feather barb and, for the first time, explain its flexural stiffness in terms of the mechanics of asymmetric foam-filled beams subjected to bending. The results are correlated and validated with finite element modeling\n######################\noutput:", "parameters": {"model": "mistral-nemo:12b-instruct-2407-fp16", "temperature": 0.5, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 1024, "n": 1}}
