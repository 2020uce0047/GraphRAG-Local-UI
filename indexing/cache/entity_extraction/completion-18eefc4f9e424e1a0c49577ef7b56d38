Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Wasps were trained to discriminate between five elements in series (A0B\u201a\u00e0\u00ed, B0C\u201a\u00e0\u00ed, C0D\u201a\u00e0\u00ed, D0E\u201a\u00e0\u00ed), then tested on novel, untrained pairs (B versus D). Consistent with TI, wasps chose B more frequently than D. Wasps organized the trained stimuli into an implicit hierarchy and used TI to choose between untrained pairs. Species that form social hierarchies like Polistes may be predisposed to spontaneously organize information along a common underlying dimension. This work contributes to a growing body of evidence that the miniature nervous system of insects does not limit sophisticated behaviours.\",TRUE\nTranspiration Through the Cuticle of Insects,\"Transpiration through the cuticle of insects is restricted by a thin layer of orientated wax on the outer surface of the epicuticle. In some insects at least this wax layer is covered by a thin layer of cement.When heated to a certain temperature the wax layer shows an abrupt increase in permeability to water. This \u201a\u00c4\u00f2critical temperature\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 varies widely in different species and in different stages of the same species. It is highest in those insects which are most resistant to desiccation.In the newly formed puparium of Calliphora the impermeable film of wax is wholly superficial as in other insects. But after pupation the main impermeable layer is on the surface of the true pupa. The critical temperature of the pupa is much higher than that of the puparium.Abrasion of the wax layer results in a great increase in transpiration through the cuticle. Inert dusts cause the desiccation of insects by getting between the moving surfaces of the cuticle and abrading the wax layer. Such dusts in stationary contact with the cuticle will not remove the wax by adsorption; hence they are without action on dead or motionless insects.(The cockroach is an exception to this. Here the water proof layer is a soft grease, freely exposed on the surface; it is largely removed by adsorption on to the dusts.)The places where the wax has been abraded can be demonstrated by immersing the insect in ammoniacal silver solution. The phenol-containing epicuticle stains deep brown only where the protective layer of wax has been removed.Although the epicuticle shows no visible injury as the result of abrasion, the underlying cells react as though they had been wounded, and\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "phi3:latest", "temperature": 0.5, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 8192, "n": null}}
