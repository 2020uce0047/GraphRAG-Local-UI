Therefore, we quantified molecular forces across the essential integrin-binding protein Talin, which links integrin to the actin cytoskeleton. Generating flies expressing 3 F\u221a\u2202rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based Talin tension sensors reporting different force levels between 1 and 11 piconewton (pN) enabled us to quantify physiologically relevant molecular forces. By measuring primary Drosophila muscle cells, we demonstrate that Drosophila Talin experiences mechanical forces in cell culture that are similar to those previously reported for Talin in mammalian cell lines. However, in vivo force measurements at developing flight muscle attachment sites revealed that average forces across Talin are comparatively low and decrease even further while attachments mature and tissue-level tension remains high. Concomitantly, the Talin concentration at attachment sites increases 5-fold as quantified by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), suggesting that only a small proportion of Talin molecules are mechanically engaged at any given time. Reducing Talin levels at late stages of muscle development results in muscle\u201a\u00c4\u00ectendon rupture in the adult fly, likely as a result of active muscle contractions. We therefore propose that a large pool of adhesion molecules is required to share high tissue forces. As a result, less than 15% of the molecules experience detectable forces at developing muscle attachment sites at the same time. Our findings define an important new concept of how cells can adapt to changes in tissue mechanics to prevent mechanical failure in vivo.\",TRUE\n\"A specialized avian seed dispersal system in a dry-fruited non-photosynthetic plant, Balanophora yakushimensis.\",\"The family Balanophoraceae are among the most unusual of plants because they have aberrant vegetative bodies, highly reduced flowers, and small and reduced embryos (Hansen 1972, Gonzalez et al. 2019). Because the plants lack chlorophyll and are incapable of photosynthesis, they draw nutrition from other organisms. Indeed, like the well-known parasitic plant, Rafflesia, members of the Balanophoraceae acquire both water and nutrients from host plants. They are, therefore, highly specialized root parasites.\",TRUE\nA spider that feeds indirectly on vertebrate blood by choosing female mosquitoes as prey.,\"Spiders do not feed directly on vertebrate blood\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "sciphi/triplex:latest", "temperature": 0.5, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 1024, "n": null}}
