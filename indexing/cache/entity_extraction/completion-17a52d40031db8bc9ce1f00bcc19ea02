{"result": " As an expert in the field, I would advise you to follow these steps to start a small-scale organic farm:\n\n1. **Research and Planning**: Learn about local farming regulations, market demands for crops or livestock products in your area, and sustainable agriculture practices. Consider attending workshops on organic farming techniques offered by organizations such as the Organic Farming Association (OFA) to gain knowledge and skills needed.\n2. **Land Assessment**: Select a suitable plot of land with fertile soil that receives adequate sunlight, water accessibility, and is not contaminated by chemicals from previous uses. The ideal size for a small-scale farm usually ranges between 1 to 5 acres.\n3. **Business Planning**: Develop a business plan that outlines your goals, costs, expected income, marketing strategies, and financial projections. Consult with an agricultural advisor or local extension office for assistance in creating this document.\n4. **Certification**: Obtain organic certification from a recognized body such as the USDA's National Organic Program (NOP) to legally market your products as \"organic.\"\n5. **Soil Preparation**: Conduct soil tests and enhance soil fertility using natural methods like composting, green manure crops, crop rotation, or cover cropping to improve soil health without the use of synthetic chemicals. \n6. **Crop Selection**: Choose a diverse range of crops suitable for your climate and market demand. Consider starting with high-value products that are easy to grow organically, such as herbs, vegetables or fruits.\n7. **Infrastructure Development**: Build necessary facilities like barns, storage areas, greenhouses, irrigation systems, etc., while ensuring they comply with organic standards (avoiding materials that might contaminate the soil).\n8. **Livestock Management** (if applicable): If you're including livestock in your farm, make sure to provide adequate shelter and pasture land for grazing while maintaining strict health monitoring protocols to prevent disease outbreaks.\n9. **Marketing Plan Development**: Establish connections with local markets, farmers' cooperatives, or Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) programs, which help connect consumers directly with your farm.\n10. **Sustainable Practices Implementation**: Incorporate sustainable practices such as conserving water through drip irrigation, using renewable energy sources for operations, and minimizing waste by composting organic matter to close the nutrient loop on your farm.\n11. **Education & Training**: Continuous learning is key; keep up with advances in organic farming techniques through training programs or agricultural courses provided by universities or institutions like ATTRA (National Sustainable Agriculture Information Service).\n\nBy adhering to these guidelines, you'll be well on your way to establishing a successful and sustainable small-scale organic farm.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

The wake (and implied wing aerodynamics) are not well described by discrete vortex loop models, but a new wake-based model, where incremental spanwise and streamwise variations of the wake impulse are integrated over the wingbeat, shows good agreement of the vertical momentum flux with the required weight support. The total drag was also estimated from the wake alone, and the calculated lift:drag ratio of approximately 13 for flapping flight is the highest measured yet for birds.\",TRUE\nWake-induced \u201a\u00c4\u00f2slaloming\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 response explains exquisite sensitivity of seal whisker-like sensors,\"Blindfolded harbour seals are able to use their uniquely shaped whiskers to track vortex wakes left by moving animals and identify objects that passed by 30 s earlier, an impressive feat, as the flow features have velocities as low as 1 mm s\u201a\u00e0\u00ed1 . The seals sense while swimming, hence their whiskers are sensitive enough to detect small-scale changes in the flow, while rejecting self-generated flow noise. Here we identify and illustrate a novel flow mechanism, causing a large-amplitude \u201a\u00c4\u00f2slaloming\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 whisker response, which allows artificial whiskers with the identical unique undulatory geometry as those of the harbour seal to detect the features of minute flow fluctuations when placed within wakes. Whereas in open water the whisker responds with very low-amplitude vibration, once within a wake, it oscillates with large amplitude and, importantly, its response frequency coincides with the Strouhal frequency of the upstream cylinder, making the detection of an upstream wake and an estimation of the size and shape of the wake-generating body possible. This mechanism has some similarities with the flow mechanisms observed in actively controlled propulsive foils within upstream wakes and trout swimming behind bluff cylinders in a stream, but there are also differences caused by the unique whisker morphology, which enables it to respond passively and within a much wider parametric range.\",TRUE\n\"Water balance and osmoregulation in Physadesmia globosa, a diurnal tenebrionid beetle from the Namib desert\",\"Abstract Dehydration (10 days at 26\u00ac\u221eC) of the Namib tenebrionid beetle Physadesmia globosa resulted in rapid weight loss (approx. 19%), and a substantial decline in haemolymph volume (61%).
