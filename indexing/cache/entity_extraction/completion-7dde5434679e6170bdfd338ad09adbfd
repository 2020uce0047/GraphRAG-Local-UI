Each spicule is covered with recurved barbs and has an internal architecture consisting of a solid core of silica surrounded by an assembly of coaxial silica cylinders, each of which is separated by a thin organic layer. The thickness of each silica cylinder progressively decreases from the spicule\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s core to its periphery, which we hypothesize is an adaptation for redistributing internal stresses, thus increasing the overall strength of each spicule. To evaluate this hypothesis, we created a spicule structural mechanics model, in which we fixed the radii of the silica cylinders such that the force transmitted from the surface barbs to the remainder of the skeletal system was maximized. Compared with measurements of these parameters in the native sponge spicules, our modeling results correlate remarkably well, highlighting the beneficial nature of this elastically heterogeneous lamellar design strategy. The structural principles obtained from this study thus provide potential design insights for the fabrication of high-strength beams for load-bearing applications through the modification of their internal architecture, rather than their external geometry.\",TRUE\nNew materials for solar thermal storage\u201a\u00c4\u00eesolid/liquid transitions in fatty acid esters,\"Abstract Solid/liquid transitions were studied by DSC measurements in the following fatty acid esters: methyl stearate, methyl palmitate, cetyl stearate, cetyl palmitate and their binary mixtures. Four systems, with phase transition temperature close to room temperature and with high enthalpy of transition and low hysteresis, were selected for further studies relevant to passive solar thermal storage. The selected systems were: methyl palmitate and the eutectic mixtures of methyl stearate\u201a\u00c4\u00ecmethyl palmitate, methyl stearte\u201a\u00c4\u00eccetyl palmitate and methyl stearate\u201a\u00c4\u00eccetyl stearate. The samples, studied in 50 thermal cycles with programmed heating/cooling in the temperature range \u201a\u00e0\u00ed10\u201a\u00c4\u00ec60\u00ac\u221eC remained stable. The studies of the samples, having been stored at room temperature, were repeated after an interval of 18 months. The results showed that the relevant thermophysical properties did not change. The commercial building materials (gypsum, bricks) were impregnated homogeneously with the selected molten esters by simple immersion. DSC studies showed that up to \u201a\u00e2\u00e030\u00ac\u2020mass% of esters can be adsorbed in the building materials.
