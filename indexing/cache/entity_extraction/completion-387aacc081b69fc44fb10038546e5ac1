{"result": " Hi there! I'd be happy to help you create a Python program for calculating the area and perimeter of various geometric shapes. Let's start with some basic ones: rectangle, square, circle, triangle (equilateral), and right-angled triangle. To ensure flexibility, we can use classes so that we could add more shapes later on without changing much code. Here is a simple example for you to get started:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nclass Shape():\n    def area(self):\n        pass\n        \n    def perimeter(self):\n        pass\n\n\nclass Rectangle(Shape):\n    def __init__(self, width, height):\n        self.width = width\n        self.height = height\n    \n    def area(self):\n        return self.width * self.height\n        \n    def perimeter(self):\n        return 2*(self.width + self.height)\n\nclass Square(Rectangle): # Inherits from Rectangle as a square is just a special case of rectangle\n    def __init__(self, side_length):\n        super().__init__(side_length, side_length)\n        \n    @property\n    def diagonal(self):\n        return self.width*math.sqrt(2)  # Pythagoras theorem\n    \nclass Circle(Shape):\n    def __init__(self, radius):\n        self.radius = radius\n        \n    def area(self):\n        return math.pi * self.radius ** 2\n        \n    def perimeter (self):\n        return 2*math.pi*self.radius  # Also known as circumference\n\nclass Triangle:\n    \n    def __init__(self, side_length):\n        self.side_length = side_length\n        \n    def area(self):\n        return (math.sqrt(3)/4)*(self.side_length**2) # For equilateral triangle using Heron's formula with s=a\n    \nclass RightTriangle: \n    def __init__(self, a, b):  \n        self.a = a\n        self.b = b\n        \n    def area(self):\n        return 0.5*self.a*self.b\n        \n    def perimeter (self):\n        # Pythagorean Theorem to find the hypotenuse, then add all sides\n        c = math.sqrt(self.a**2 + self.b**2)\n        return self.a + self.b + c\n\n# Example usage:        \nrectangle_1 = Rectangle(5, 6)\nsquare_1 = Square(4)\ncircle_1 = Circle(3)\ntriangle_1 = Triangle(7)\nright_triangle_1 = RightTriangle(3, 4)\n\nprint(\"Rectangle Area: \", rectangle_1.area())\nprint(\"Square Area: \", square_1.area())\nprint(\"Circle Area: \", circle_1.area())\nprint(\"Triangle Area: \", triangle_1.area())\nprint(\"Right Triangle Area: \", right_triangle_1.area())\n```\n\nThis code defines a base class `Shape` with methods for calculating the area and perimeter (which are initially not implemented). Each geometric shape is represented by its own class that inherits from `Shape`. The calculation of these properties depends on their unique formulas: rectangle/square uses width*height, circle uses pi*r^2, equilateral triangle uses sqrt(3)/4 * side_length^2 and right-angled triangle uses 0.5ab for area and Pythagorean theorem for perimeter. For the square class, we take advantage of inheritance from rectangle, since a square is just a special type of rectangle. The `diagonal` property in Square returns diagonal length using Pythagoras theorem which isn't calculated here but can be easily added if needed.\nPlease note that for equilateral triangle the side_length must always equal all three sides, and the right-angled triangle requires two non-equal sides as arguments.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

Although ostriches did use acceleration or braking forces to control body rotation, their morphology allowed for both crossovers and sidesteps to be accomplished with minimal net acceleratory/braking force production. Moreover, body roll and ab/adduction of the leg shifted the foot position away from the turn direction, reducing the acceleratory/braking forces required to prevent under- or over-rotation and aligning the leg with the ground reaction force.\",TRUE\n\"Mechanics of Jet Propulsion in the Hydromedusan Jellyfish, Polyorchis Pexicillatus: I. Mechanical Properties of the Locomotor Structure\",\"A non-destructive test was developed to measure the static mechanical properties of the locomotor structure (bell) in the hydromedusan jellyfish, Polyorchis penicillatus (Eschscholtz, 1829). A nonlinear stress-strain relationship was found, and the mean static structural stiffness of the bell was 150 N m\u201a\u00e0\u00ed2. Visualization procedures that showed the natural changes in the geometry of the deformation of the bell were used to calculate the static modulus of elasticity of the mesoglea, and gave a modulus of 400 N m\u201a\u00e0\u00ed2. Dynamic measurements on isolated samples of mesoglea gave a mean storage modulus of 1000 N m\u201a\u00e0\u00ed2. The resilience of the material was about 58%. These data were integrated to imply that the dynamic structural stiffness of the bell is at least 400 N m\u201a\u00e0\u00ed2. Attempts to measure the dynamic structural stiffness directly indicate that the dynamic stiffness of the intact bell lies between 400 and 1000 N m\u201a\u00e0\u00ed2. All, or most, of the potential energy stored in the mesoglea during contractions of the bell is stored as strain energy in the radial mesogleal fibres.\",TRUE\nMechanics without Muscle: Biomechanical Inspiration from the Plant World,\"Plant and animal biomechanists have much in common.
