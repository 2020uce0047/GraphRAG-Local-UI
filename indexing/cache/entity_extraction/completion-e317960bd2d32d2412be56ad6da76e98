Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

[52], Howe et al. [53], Bennett et al. [48], and Raudsepp-Hearne et al. [54] (see Figure 1).\n\nConsidering the temporal aspects of ecosystem services are also crucial, though often not considered in either the examination of ecosystem services or within a design context [49,55].\n\nThe \u2018strategies for designing urban ecosystem services diagram\u2019 is both a compilation of existing designs, concepts, and strategies that generate ecosystem services, as well as a relational map that displays existing connections between ecosystem services when integrated in urban designs. It becomes more effective if used in conjunction with an understanding of synergetic or trade-off relationships between existing and potential ecosystem services (as illustrated in Figure 1). For example, a particular project may have a focus on trying to design a building that is able to contribute to purification of air, water, and soil. The \u2018strategies for designing urban ecosystem services diagram\u2019 can be used to show that several existing methods such as bioremediation, contaminant absorption, and vertical forests could be investigated for suitability for the project. Case studies demonstrating how such strategies or technologies have been used are also available through the diagram. Figure 1 demonstrates that such a project should also be aware that a singular focus on purification could have synergies with the provision of fresh water, provision of habitat, species maintenance, and soil building ecosystem services if designed strategically. Figure 1 also shows that a potential trade off with purification exists with food provision if not considered at the design stage (this could occur for example if an urban wetland is used for the purification of water in place of an urban orchard).\n\n\n\n\n\nBiomimetics 2020, 5, 18\n\n7 of 17\n\nBiomimetics 2019, 4, x FOR PEER REVIEW\n\n7 of 17\n\n\n\nFigure 1.\n\nFigure 1.
