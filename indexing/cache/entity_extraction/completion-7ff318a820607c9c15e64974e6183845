We also present calculations of the adhesive pressure exerted by these suctorial organs during real prey capture events.\",TRUE\nA study of mucus from the solitary coral Fungia fungites (Scleractinia: Fungiidae) in relation to photobiological UV adaptation,\"The ultraviolet (UV)-absorbance spectrum (300 to 360 nm) of mucus obtained from Fungia fungites (L. 1758, collected in Tahiti in 1991) after being exposed to air for up to 5 min was measured, and UV-absorbing compounds were demonstrated to be present in the mucus, with a peak at 332 nm. The concentration of these UV-absorbing compounds was at a maximum in the first 2 min of secretion and decreased thereafter. Concentration was significantly related to the weight of the coral. Also, as corals were adapted to bathymetric levels of UV radiation, mucus concentration of UV-absorbing compounds decreased significantly with increasing depth.\",TRUE\nA symbiotic bacterium of shipworms produces a compound with broad spectrum anti-apicomplexan activity,\"Apicomplexan parasites cause severe disease in both humans and their domesticated animals. Since these parasites readily develop drug resistance, development of new, effective drugs to treat infection caused by these parasites is an ongoing challenge for the medical and veterinary communities. We hypothesized that invertebrate-bacterial symbioses might be a rich source of anti-apicomplexan compounds because invertebrates are susceptible to infections with gregarines, parasites that are ancestral to all apicomplexans. We chose to explore the therapeutic potential of shipworm symbiotic bacteria as they are bona fide symbionts, are easily grown in axenic culture and have genomes rich in secondary metabolite loci [1,2]. Two strains of the shipworm symbiotic bacterium, Teredinibacter turnerae, were screened for activity against Toxoplasma gondii and one strain, T7901, exhibited activity against intracellular stages of the parasite. Bioassay-guided fractionation identified tartrolon E (trtE) as the source of the activity. TrtE has an EC50 of 3 nM against T. gondii, acts directly on the parasite itself and kills the parasites after two hours of treatment. TrtE exhibits nanomolar to picomolar level activity against Cryptosporidium, Plasmodium,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "sciphi/triplex:latest", "temperature": 0.5, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 1024, "n": null}}
