{"result": " In order to design a website that adheres to WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards, we need to take into account several key factors. Here is an example of what this might look like for a landing page:\n\n1. Semantic HTML Structure - Use appropriate tags such as header, main, aside and footer that help users with assistive technologies understand the layout and organization of content on your webpage. \n\n```HTML\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n <title>Accessible Landing Page</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n <header role=\"banner\">\n   <!-- Site logo, navigation etc. goes here -->\n </header>\n \n <main role=\"main\">\n    <h1>Landing Page Title</h1>\n    <!-- Content of the main section of your page goes here-->\n </main>\n\n<aside role=\"complementary\">\n   <!-- Sidebar content such as additional information or navigation -->\n </aside>\n \n <footer role=\"contentinfo\">\n   <!-- Footer content like copyright, contact info etc. -->\n</footer>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n2. Text Alternatives - Provide alt attributes for all images so that screen readers can describe them to users who are visually impaired or blind. \n\n```HTML\n<img src=\"image_src\" alt=\"Description of the image\">\n```\n\n3. Keyboard Accessibility - Ensure your website is fully navigable via a keyboard. This includes making sure all functionality, like forms and custom controls, can be accessed using only tab keys and enter/space bar to select items. \n   \n4. Color Contrast - Make sure the text color contrasts with its background in order for people with visual impairments to read it easily. You may use online tools such as WebAIM's Contrast Checker tool.\n   \n5. ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) Labels - Provide ARIA labels or descriptions where necessary, especially on complex interactive elements like sliders or dropdown menus. \n   \n```HTML\n<button aria-label=\"Submit\">Submit</button>\n<img src=\"icon_src\" role=\"presentation\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n```\n  \n6. Captioning and Transcripts - Include captions for any multimedia content, such as videos or animations, to accommodate users with hearing impairments.\n   \nRemember that this is not an exhaustive list of all the requirements you need to meet according to WCAG 2.1 (Level AA), and each website will have unique needs based on its specific use-cases. Therefore, it's always recommended to thoroughly check your site with accessibility testing tools or seek professional help if necessary to ensure full compliance with these guidelines.\n   \nIt is also important to remember that making a website accessible not only benefits users with disabilities but improves the overall user experience and usability of your site for all visitors, so it's definitely worth investing time and effort in accessibility design.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

The scales gape open when it is dry, releasing the cone's seeds. When it is damp, the scales close up. The cells in a mature cone are dead, so the mechanism is passive: the structure of the scale and the walls of the cells composing the scale respond to changing relative humidity. Dissection of cones from the Monterey pine, Pinus radiata, revealed to us two types of scale growing from the main body of the cone \u201a\u00c4\u00ee the ovuliferous scale and the bract scale. The larger ovuliferous scales respond to changes in relative humidity when removed from the body of the cone.\",TRUE\nHow snapping shrimp snap: through cavitating bubbles.,\"The snapping shrimp (Alpheus heterochaelis) produces a loud snapping sound by an extremely rapid closure of its snapper claw. One of the effects of the snapping is to stun or kill prey animals. During the rapid snapper claw closure, a high-velocity water jet is emitted from the claw with a speed exceeding cavitation conditions. Hydrophone measurements in conjunction with time-controlled high-speed imaging of the claw closure demonstrate that the sound is emitted at the cavitation bubble collapse and not on claw closure. A model for the bubble dynamics based on a Rayleigh-Plesset-type equation quantitatively accounts for the time dependence of the bubble radius and for the emitted sound.\",TRUE\nHow super is supercontraction? Persistent versus cyclic responses to humidity in spider dragline silk,\"SUMMARY Spider dragline silk has enormous potential for the development of biomimetic fibers that combine strength and elasticity in low density polymers. These applications necessitate understanding how silk reacts to different environmental conditions. For instance, spider dragline silk `supercontracts' in high humidity. During supercontraction, unrestrained dragline silk contracts up to 50% of its original length and restrained fibers generate substantial stress. Here we characterize the response of dragline silk to changes in humidity before, during and after supercontraction. Our findings demonstrate that dragline silk exhibits two qualitatively different responses to humidity. First, silk undergoes a previously unknown cyclic relaxation\u201a\u00c4\u00eccontraction response to wetting and drying. The direction and magnitude of this cyclic response is identical both before and after supercontraction. By contrast, supercontraction is a `permanent' tensioning of restrained silk in\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "phi3:latest", "temperature": 0.5, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 8192, "n": null}}
