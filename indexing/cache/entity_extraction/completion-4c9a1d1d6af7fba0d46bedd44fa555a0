Species inhabiting lotic regimes often adapt to these conditions by evolving low\u201a\u00c4\u00eadrag (i.e., streamlined) morphologies that reduce the likelihood of dislodgment or displacement. However, hydrodynamic factors are not the only selective pressures influencing organismal morphology and shapes well suited to flow conditions may compromise performance in other roles. We investigated the possibility of morphological trade\u201a\u00c4\u00eaoffs in the turtle Pseudemys concinna. Individuals living in lotic environments have flatter, more streamlined shells than those living in lentic environments; however, this flatter shape may also make the shells less capable of resisting predator\u201a\u00c4\u00eainduced loads. We tested the idea that \u201a\u00c4\u00falotic\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 shell shapes are weaker than \u201a\u00c4\u00falentic\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 shell shapes, concomitantly examining effects of sex. Geometric morphometric data were used to transform an existing finite element shell model into a series of models corresponding to the shapes of individual turtles. Models were assigned identical material properties and loaded under identical conditions, and the stresses produced by a series of eight loads were extracted to describe the strength of the shells. \u201a\u00c4\u00faLotic\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 shell shapes produced significantly higher stresses than \u201a\u00c4\u00falentic\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 shell shapes, indicating that the former is weaker than the latter. Females had significantly stronger shell shapes than males, although these differences were less consistent than differences between flow regimes. We conclude that, despite the potential for many\u201a\u00c4\u00eato\u201a\u00c4\u00eaone mapping of shell shape onto strength, P. concinna experiences a trade\u201a\u00c4\u00eaoff in shell shape between hydrodynamic and mechanical performance. This trade\u201a\u00c4\u00eaoff may be evident in many other turtle species or any other aquatic species that also depend on a shell for defense. However, evolution of body size may provide an avenue of escape from this trade\u201a\u00c4\u00eaoff in some cases, as changes in size can drastically affect mechanical performance while having little effect on hydrodynamic performance.
