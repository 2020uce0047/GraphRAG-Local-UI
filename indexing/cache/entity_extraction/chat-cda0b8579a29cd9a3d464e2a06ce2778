Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [Desert, Lark, Skin, Ceramide, Free fatty acid, Water vapor, Beetle, Mountain pine beetle, Bone, Piezoelectric scaffold, Shark, Wood frog, Mycosporine-like amino acid, Termite, Mound]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in Here's a simplified summary of each text in plain language:\n\n1. **Bird Skin Lipids Adaptation to Desert Environments**\n   - Larks living in hot, dry deserts have less water loss from their skin compared to those in more humid environments.\n   - Instead of having more lipids in their skin (stratum corneum), desert larks have a higher proportion of certain ceramides and fewer free fatty acids. This makes the lipid layers more ordered and creates a tighter barrier against water vapor diffusion, reducing water loss.\n\n2. **Mountain Pine Beetle Flight and Host Colonization**\n   - Female mountain pine beetles that fly longer distances and lose more body mass during flight are less likely to colonize new hosts (trees) but produce more aggregation pheromone.\n   - Male beetles' production of attraction pheromone is affected by their condition after flying, not the energy used during flight.\n   - This variation in flight behavior helps maintain population levels by balancing safe and risky host colonization strategies.\n\n3. **Piezoelectric Scaffold for Adaptive Bone Tissue Engineering**\n   - A new material system is developed that can adapt its mechanical properties in response to external stress.\n   - Piezoelectric scaffolds generate charges when stressed, which induce mineralization from surrounding media, reinforcing regions of high stress or damaged areas.\n   - This self-regenerating material could help address challenges in load-bearing applications by adapting to changing stress conditions.\n\n4. **Daily Variation of UV-Protective Compounds in Marine Dinoflagellate**\n   - The marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae increases its production of UV-absorbing compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids) when exposed to high photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) or PAR plus ultraviolet radiation (UVR).\n   - These compounds help protect the dinoflagellate from UV damage.\n\n5. **Termite Mounds as Passive Ventilation Systems**\n   - Termite mounds in different environments use periodic solar heating to drive internal ventilation, functioning like an external lung for the colony.\n   - Despite differences in gas stratification and overturning patterns, termite architectures can harness solar energy to facilitate gas exchange, with implications for human engineering. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter. If you have to translate, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!\n\n4.

Because of this stiff coupling, forces acting on the hairs can be transmitted to the shaft and thus to the auditory sensory organ at the base of the flagellum, a process that is proposed to improve acoustic sensitivity. Indeed, the mechanical sensitivity of the male antenna not only exceeds the sensitivity of the female antenna but also those of all other arthropod movement receivers studied so far.\"\nSENSE_SOUND/VIBRATIONS,\"Hyperacute directional hearing in a microscale auditory system The physics of sound propagation imposes fundamental constraints on sound localization: for a given frequency, the smaller the receiver, the smaller the available cues.

Silk proteins are reminiscent of amphiphilic block copolymers containing stretches of polyalanine and glycine-rich polar elements forming a repetitive core flanked by highly conserved non-repetitive amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal domains. The N-terminal domain comprises a secretion signal, but further functions remain unassigned. The C-terminal domain was implicated in the control of solubility and fibre formation initiated by changes in ionic composition and mechanical stimuli known to align the repetitive sequence elements and promote \u0152\u2264-sheet formation. However, despite recent structural data, little is known about this remarkable behaviour in molecular detail. Here we present the solution structure of the C-terminal domain of a spider dragline silk protein and provide evidence that the structural state of this domain is essential for controlled switching between the storage and assembly forms of silk proteins. In addition, the C-terminal domain also has a role in the alignment of secondary structural features formed by the repetitive elements in the backbone of spider silk proteins, which is known to be important for the mechanical properties of the fibre.\",TRUE\nA Cultured Greigite-Producing Magnetotactic Bacterium in a Novel Group of Sulfate-Reducing Bacteria,\"The crystal structure of biomineralized magnetic nanocrystals depends on environmental and genetic factors. Magnetotactic bacteria contain magnetosomes\u201a\u00c4\u00eeintracellular, membrane-bounded, magnetic nanocrystals of magnetite (Fe3O4) or greigite (Fe3S4)\u201a\u00c4\u00eethat cause the bacteria to swim along geomagnetic field lines. We isolated a greigite-producing magnetotactic bacterium from a brackish spring in Death Valley National Park, California, USA, strain BW-1, that is able to biomineralize greigite and magnetite depending on culture conditions. A phylogenetic comparison of BW-1 and similar uncultured greigite- and/or magnetite-producing magnetotactic bacteria from freshwater to hypersaline habitats shows that these organisms represent a previously unknown group of sulfate-reducing bacteria in the Deltaproteobacteria. Genomic analysis of BW-1 reveals the presence of two different magnetosome gene clusters, suggesting that one may be responsible for greigite biomineralization and the other for magnetite.\",TRUE\nA dinoflagellate exploits toxins to immobilize prey prior to ingestion,\"Toxins produced by the harmful algal bloom (HAB) forming, mixotrophic dinoflagellate\n######################\noutput:", "parameters": {"model": "mistral-nemo:12b-instruct-2407-fp16", "temperature": 0.5, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 1024, "n": 1}}
