Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Step Two: Relational Database Compilation\n\nThe results of step one were compiled into a database that identified relationships between design strategies, concepts, and technologies, and specific ecosystem services. Case studies were also added to the database. The database was developed in the Microsoft Excel program (Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013). Relationships between 160 distinct design strategies, concepts and technologies that work towards ecosystem services generation were defined.\n\n2.2.3. Step Three: Complex System Visualization\n\nThe final step was to design an interactive online visualization of the database that captured the ecosystem services and design strategies identified, as well as the relationships between them.\n\nIn order to create a holistic understanding of complex systems, Suoheimo & Miettinen [62] suggest employing complexity mapping as a tool. A qualitative visualization of complex systems shows interconnections, patterns, and dynamics of the participating elements [63]. In order to understand the relationships between each element in more depth, the complexity map was first drafted in several iterations manually with sticky notes and hand drawn lines on a board. This particular methodology is common in complex systems mapping [62].\n\n\n\n\n\nBiomimetics 2020, 5, 18\n\n9 of 17\n\nTo ensure effective visualization of the data, several online qualitative complexity mapping web-based software and platforms were tested for suitability. The mapping tools investigated for their usability and functionality included bubbl.us [64], MindMup [65], 7Vortex [66], and Kumu [62].\n\nKumu was the platform selected due to its flexibility in structuring, connecting, and controlling the visualization of the data. Kumu was created by J. and R. Mohr in 2011 and enables the mapping of relationships and the visualization of complex systems and large datasets. An additional reason for the selection of Kumu was that the developed database spreadsheet (step two of the research process) could be transferred to the platform for automated updating.\n\nWithin the \u2018strategies for designing urban ecosystem services\u2019 diagram each discrete ecosystem service, or design strategy, or case study became a small circle within Kumu and is termed an \u2018element\u2019.\n\nIn total, there are 348 elements in the diagram.\n\nThrough an iterative design-led research process, it became clear that organizing the elements into a series of concentric circles made the relational complexity diagram easier to use and understand and meant that users could start from the middle of the diagram with the intention of designing for a specific ecosystem service, or they could start from the outermost circle from the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "phi3:latest", "temperature": 0.5, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 8192, "n": null}}
