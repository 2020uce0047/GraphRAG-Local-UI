The structure of a Toco toucan (Ramphastos toco) beak was found to be a sandwich composite with an exterior of keratin and a fibrous network of closed cells made of calcium-rich proteins. The keratin layer is comprised of superposed hexagonal scales (50\u00ac\u2020\u0152\u00bam diameter and 1\u00ac\u2020\u0152\u00bam thickness) glued together. Its tensile strength is about 50\u00ac\u2020MPa and Young\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s modulus is 1.4\u00ac\u2020GPa. Micro and nanoindentation hardness measurements corroborate these values. The keratin shell exhibits a strain-rate sensitivity with a transition from slippage of the scales due to release of the organic glue, at a low strain rate (5\u00ac\u2020\u221a\u00f3\u00ac\u202010\u201a\u00e0\u00ed5/s) to fracture of the scales at a higher strain rate (1.5\u00ac\u2020\u221a\u00f3\u00ac\u202010\u201a\u00e0\u00ed3/s). The closed-cell foam is comprised of fibers having a Young\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s modulus twice as high as the keratin shells due to their higher calcium content. The compressive response of the foam was modeled by the Gibson\u201a\u00c4\u00ecAshby constitutive equations for open and closed-cell foam. There is a synergistic effect between foam and shell evidenced by experiments and analysis establishing the separate responses of shell, foam, and foam\u00ac\u2020+\u00ac\u2020shell. The stability analysis developed by Karam and Gibson, assuming an idealized circular cross section, was applied to the beak. It shows that the foam stabilizes the deformation of the beak by providing an elastic foundation which increases its Brazier and buckling load under flexure loading.\",TRUE\nStructure of the avian respiratory tract.,\"Abstract The avian lung is firmly attached to the thoracic wall and to the underlying horizontal septum. Its volume remains constant during respiration. Air sacs lie beneath the horizontal septum, the oblique septum separating them from the intestines; the abdominal air sac occupies the dorsal abdominal cavity.
