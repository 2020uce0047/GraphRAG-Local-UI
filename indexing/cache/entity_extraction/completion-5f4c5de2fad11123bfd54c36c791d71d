This study examines the material and structural properties of the byssal threads of three mussel species: Mytilus californianus, M. trossulus, and M. galloprovincialis. Tensile tests in general reveal similar material properties among species: the proximal region has a lower initial modulus, a lower ultimate stress and a higher ultimate strain than the distal region. The distal region also yields at a stress well below its ultimate value. In whole thread tests, the proximal region and adhesive plaque are common sites of structural failure and are closely matched in strength, while the distal region appears to be excessively strong. We propose that the high strength of the distal region is the byproduct of a material designed to yield and extend before structural failure occurs. Experimental and theoretical evidence is presented suggesting that thread yield and extensibility provide two important mechanisms for increasing the overall attachment strength of the mussel: (1) the reorientation of threads towards the direction of applied load, and (2) the 'recruitment' of more threads into tension and the consequent distribution of applied load over a larger cross-sectional area, thereby reducing the stress on each thread. This distal region yield behavior is most striking for M. californianus and may be a key to its success in extreme wave-swept environments.\"\nMANAGE_STRESS/STRAIN,\"Strong ultralight foams based on nanocrystalline cellulose for high-performance insulation. Environmentally friendly, sustainable, and high-performance thermal insulators are in high demand. Petroleum-based insulator foams usually have high thermal conductivity and pose health hazards. Here, we report ultralight composite foams that are highly strong, elastic, and super-insulating. The foams are composed of nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) (74\u201a\u00c4\u00e2wt%), polyvinyl alcohol (7.5\u201a\u00c4\u00e2wt%), and a crosslinking agent (18.5\u201a\u00c4\u00e2wt%). The fabrication process is simple and uses only water. The composite foams exhibit an elastic strain of \u00c0\u00fa13% at a modulus of 250\u201a\u00c4\u00e2K\u201a\u00c4\u00e2Pa and a stress of 73\u201a\u00c4\u00e2K\u201a\u00c4\u00e2Pa at 50% strain (100+ and 18 times, respectively, higher than those of pure NCC foam); both exceed the values of reported nanocellulose-based foams with no reinforcement.
