THE RETE MIRABILE,\"1. The structure and dimensions are given for the rete mirabile. It is interpreted as a counter current diffusion exchange mechanism between the afferent and efferent rete.2. This diffusion exchange has been quantitatively evaluated for O2, CO2, and N2. The arrangement makes possible the maintenance of a steep tension gradient within the rete, so that the oxygen loss from the leaving blood can be extremely low.3. Quantitative evaluation of the efficiency of the rete diffusion makes it clear that the limiting equilibrium pressure in the swimbladder could be extremely high, and that the limiting factor lies mainly in the dissociation pressure of the chemical or physical reaction which ultimately splits off the oxygen.4. The nature of the responsible compound and reaction is unknown. The anatomical arrangement of the glandular structure and the rete is suggestive of a cellular secretion of oxygen rather than of a mechanism that splits off oxygen in the blood.5.

The mechanisms by which these viruses are maintained in individuals or populations of reservoir bats remain an enigma. Mathematical models have predicted long-term persistent infection with low levels of periodic shedding as a likely route for virus maintenance and spillover from bats. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that bat cells and MERS coronavirus (CoV) can co-exist in vitro . To test our hypothesis, we established a long-term coronavirus infection model of bat cells that are persistently infected with MERS-CoV. We infected cells from Eptesicus fuscus with MERS-CoV and maintained them in culture for at least 126 days. We characterized the persistently infected cells by detecting virus particles, protein and transcripts. Basal levels of type I interferon in the long-term infected bat cells were higher, relative to uninfected cells, and disrupting the interferon response\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "phi3:latest", "temperature": 0.5, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 8192, "n": null}}
