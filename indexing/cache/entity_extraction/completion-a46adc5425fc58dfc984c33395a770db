{"result": " To write an essay on the topic \"The Impact of Social Media on Society\", follow these steps:\n\n1. Introduction: Start with a brief introduction about social media and its prevalence in our daily lives. You could mention how it has transformed communication, businesses, entertainment, etc. The introduction should also contain your thesis statement which is the main point of discussion for your essay. For instance, you could state that although social media brings people together, it has both positive and negative impacts on society.\n2. Body Paragraph 1: Discuss the benefits of social media - this includes enhanced communication, job opportunities, ease of information dissemination etc. Provide concrete examples to support your points.\n3. Body Paragraph 2: Describe some potential drawbacks associated with its use \u2013 cyberbullying, spread of fake news/misinformation and privacy concerns among others. Again provide instances or research findings that highlight these negative effects.\n4. Conclusion: Summarize the key points made in your essay, restating both the positive aspects and negatives. End by presenting a balanced view on how social media has changed society for better and worse. \n5. Bibliography/References: List down all sources that you used to gather information during research. Ensure proper citation according to the specified format (MLA, APA etc).", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Both simulated attack and actual predator attacks against aphid hosts induced early emergence of the parasitoid larvae. Parasitoid emergence from the aphids occurred several minutes before the predator finished feeding on the aphid, allowing enough time for the parasitoid larvae to avoid direct predation. Predator-induced emergence produced significantly smaller parasitoid larvae than controls, but, interestingly, no effect on Endaphis adult size was found. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of induced emergence in an insect parasitoid, but we suggest that this mechanism might be at work in many other species where plasticity in development time allows the individual to perform an adaptive niche shift.\",TRUE\nInduced production of antifungal naphthoquinones in the pitchers of the carnivorous plant Nepenthes khasiana,\"Nepenthes spp. are carnivorous plants that have developed insect capturing traps, evolved by specific modification of the leaf tips, and are able to utilize insect degradation products as nutritional precursors. A chitin-induced antifungal ability, based on the production and secretion to the trap liquid of droserone and 5-O-methyldroserone, is described here. Such specific secretion uniquely occurred when chitin injection was used as the eliciting agent and probably reflects a certain kind of defence mechanism that has been evolved for protecting the carnivory-based provision of nutritional precursors. The pitcher liquid containing droserone and 5-O-methyldroserone at 3:1 or 4:1 molar ratio, as well as the purified naphthoquinones, exerted an antifungal effect on a wide range of plant and human fungal pathogens. When tested against Candida and Aspergillus spp., the concentrations required for achieving inhibitory and fungicidal effects were significantly lower than those causing cytotoxicity in cells of the human embryonic kidney cell line, 293T. These naturally secreted 1,4-naphthoquinone derivatives, that are assumed to act via semiquinone enhancement of free radical production, may offer a new lead to develop alternative antifungal drugs with reduced selectable pressure for potentially evolved resistance.\",TRUE\nInferring the rules of interaction of shoaling fish,\"Collective motion, where large numbers of individuals move synchronously together, is achieved when individuals adopt interaction rules that determine how they respond to their neighbors\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 movements and positions.
