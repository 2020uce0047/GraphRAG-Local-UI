{"result": " To achieve a better work-life balance, you can start by setting clear boundaries between your professional and personal life. Here are some tips to help create this separation:\n\n1. Define working hours: Specify when you will be available for work and ensure that during non-working hours, you focus on personal activities or relaxation time. Avoid checking emails and answering calls related to work outside these hours unless absolutely necessary. \n   \n2. Prioritize your tasks: Identify the most important and urgent tasks at the start of each day, so that you can manage them efficiently during office hours without having to bring work home or worry about it after hours. \n   \n3. Delegate responsibilities: If possible, delegate some of your duties to team members who have capacity to take them on; this reduces your workload and helps avoid overburdening yourself with tasks that can be handled by others.\n    \n4. Take regular breaks throughout the day for mental restoration. A quick walk or meditation session can help you stay focused and rejuvenate your energy levels, increasing productivity during working hours.\n   \n5. Utilize time management tools: Use tools like calendars, to-do lists or project management apps to manage your schedule effectively. This will give a clear overview of the day's tasks and help you stay on top of them without extending work into personal time. \n    \n6. Communicate openly with your employer about maintaining boundaries for your personal life; they may understand if you respectfully communicate how it can ultimately improve productivity during working hours by reducing stress and burnout risks. \n\nRemember, a healthy work-life balance benefits both the individual and the organization in terms of increased engagement, focus and overall job satisfaction.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

Adjusting pupil diameter in accordance with environmental regularities optimizes information transmission at ecologically relevant temporal frequencies. We show that this is the case in humans and macaque monkeys, suggesting that the reflex pathways that regulate pupil diameter are under some degree of cognitive control across primate species.\",TRUE\nPygidial glands of Harpalus pensylvanicus (Coleoptera: Carabidae) contain resilin-rich structures.,\"The pygidial gland system is a key innovation in adephagan beetles, producing, storing, and spraying defensive chemical compounds. As the source of defensive chemical production and storage, the pygidial gland system experiences severe chemical stress which challenges the integrity of the entire gland system. Here, we utilize autofluorescence-based confocal laser scanning microscopy to examine the morphology of pygidial gland secretory lobes and collecting ductules in a common Pennsylvanian harpaline species, Harpalus pensylvanicus. The glandular units are composed of type-III exocrine cells which empty into resilin-rich ductules, which themselves lead into a larger resilin-rich collecting duct, and ultimately the pygidial reservoir pump. We also utilize histological staining with toluidine blue and brightfield imaging to provide additional support for the presence of resilin in the collecting duct, as toluidine blue has been shown to stain resilin without metachromasia. We hypothesize that the high resilin content of the collecting ducts might be a widespread key evolutionary adaptation to prevent damage caused by physical and chemical stress generated in pump-containing insect exocrine gland systems.\",TRUE\n\"Pyrolobus fumarii, gen. and sp. nov., represents a novel group of archaea, extending the upper temperature limit for life to 113\u00ac\u221eC\",\"Abstract A novel, irregular, coccoid-shaped archaeum was isolated from a hydrothermally heated black smoker wall at the TAG site at the Mid Atlantic Ridge (depth 3650 meters).
