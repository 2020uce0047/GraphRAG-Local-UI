Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [Desert, Lark, Skin, Ceramide, Free fatty acid, Water vapor, Beetle, Mountain pine beetle, Bone, Piezoelectric scaffold, Shark, Wood frog, Mycosporine-like amino acid, Termite, Mound]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in Here's a simplified summary of each text in plain language:\n\n1. **Bird Skin Lipids Adaptation to Desert Environments**\n   - Larks living in hot, dry deserts have less water loss from their skin compared to those in more humid environments.\n   - Instead of having more lipids in their skin (stratum corneum), desert larks have a higher proportion of certain ceramides and fewer free fatty acids. This makes the lipid layers more ordered and creates a tighter barrier against water vapor diffusion, reducing water loss.\n\n2. **Mountain Pine Beetle Flight and Host Colonization**\n   - Female mountain pine beetles that fly longer distances and lose more body mass during flight are less likely to colonize new hosts (trees) but produce more aggregation pheromone.\n   - Male beetles' production of attraction pheromone is affected by their condition after flying, not the energy used during flight.\n   - This variation in flight behavior helps maintain population levels by balancing safe and risky host colonization strategies.\n\n3. **Piezoelectric Scaffold for Adaptive Bone Tissue Engineering**\n   - A new material system is developed that can adapt its mechanical properties in response to external stress.\n   - Piezoelectric scaffolds generate charges when stressed, which induce mineralization from surrounding media, reinforcing regions of high stress or damaged areas.\n   - This self-regenerating material could help address challenges in load-bearing applications by adapting to changing stress conditions.\n\n4. **Daily Variation of UV-Protective Compounds in Marine Dinoflagellate**\n   - The marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae increases its production of UV-absorbing compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids) when exposed to high photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) or PAR plus ultraviolet radiation (UVR).\n   - These compounds help protect the dinoflagellate from UV damage.\n\n5. **Termite Mounds as Passive Ventilation Systems**\n   - Termite mounds in different environments use periodic solar heating to drive internal ventilation, functioning like an external lung for the colony.\n   - Despite differences in gas stratification and overturning patterns, termite architectures can harness solar energy to facilitate gas exchange, with implications for human engineering. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

Because of this stiff coupling, forces acting on the hairs can be transmitted to the shaft and thus to the auditory sensory organ at the base of the flagellum, a process that is proposed to improve acoustic sensitivity. Indeed, the mechanical sensitivity of the male antenna not only exceeds the sensitivity of the female antenna but also those of all other arthropod movement receivers studied so far.\"\nSENSE_SOUND/VIBRATIONS,\"Hyperacute directional hearing in a microscale auditory system The physics of sound propagation imposes fundamental constraints on sound localization: for a given frequency, the smaller the receiver, the smaller the available cues.

The cellular core increases the resistance to buckling with little added weight. Here we analyze the detailed structure of the feather barb and, for the first time, explain its flexural stiffness in terms of the mechanics of asymmetric foam-filled beams subjected to bending. The results are correlated and validated with finite element modeling. We compare the flexure of single barbs as well as arrays of barbs and find that the interlocking adherence of barbs to one another enables a more robust structure due to minimized barb rotation during deflection. Thus, the flexure behavior of the feather vane can be tailored by the adhesive hooking between barbs, creating a system that mitigates damage. A simplified three-dimensional physical model for this interlocking mechanism is constructed by additive manufacturing. The exceptional architecture of the feather vane will motivate the design of bioinspired structures with tailored and unique properties ranging from adhesives to aerospace materials.STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEDespite its importance to bird flight, literature characterizing the feather vane is extremely limited. The feather vane is composed of barbs that branch from the main shaft (rachis) and barbules that branch from barbs. In this study, the flexural behavior of the feather barb and the role of barbule connections in reinforcing the feather vane are quantitatively investigated for the first time, both experimentally and theoretically. Through the performed experiments, structure-function relationships within the feather vane are uncovered. Additionally, in the proposed model the sophisticated structure of the barbs and the interlocking mechanism of the feather vane are simplified to understand these processes in order to engineer new lightweight structures and adhesives.\",TRUE\nA Literal Elytral Rainbow: Tunable Structural Colors Using Single Diamond Biophotonic Crystals in Pachyrrhynchus congestus Weevils.,\"The brilliant colors of many insects arise from the interference of incident light with complex nanostructured biomaterials that are present in their cuticle. Here, the rainbow-colored spots on the elytra of a snout weevil, Pachyrrhynchus congestus pavonius (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), are investigated using synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering, scanning electron microscopy, microspectrophotometry, and photonic bandgap modeling. It is shown that the iridescent scales present in the rainbow-hued spots are due to a 3D photonic crystal network of chitin in air with\n######################\noutput:", "parameters": {"model": "mistral-nemo:12b-instruct-2407-fp16", "temperature": 0.5, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 1024, "n": 1}}
