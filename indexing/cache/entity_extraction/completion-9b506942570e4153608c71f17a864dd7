Cell-to-cell communication between bacteria is mediated by small diffusible signal molecules that trigger changes in gene expression in response to fluctuations in population density. This process, generally referred to as quorum sensing (QS), controls diverse phenotypes in numerous Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Recent advances have revealed that bacteria are not limited to communication within their own species but are capable of \u201a\u00c4\u00f2listening in\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 and \u201a\u00c4\u00f2broadcasting to\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 unrelated species to intercept messages and coerce cohabitants into behavioural modifications, either for the good of the population or for the benefit of one species over another. It is also evident that QS is not limited to the bacterial kingdom. The study of two-way intercellular signalling networks between bacteria and both uni- and multicellular eukaryotes as well as between eukaryotes is just beginning to unveil a rich diversity of communication pathways.\",TRUE\nRadiative Properties of Polar Bear Hair,\"The polar bear\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s ability to survive in the harsh arctic night fascinates scientific and lay audiences alike, giving rise to anecdotal and semi-factual stories on the radiative properties of the bear\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s fur which permeate the popular literature, television programs, and textbooks [1\u201a\u00c4\u00ec5]. One of the most interesting radiative properties of polar bear fur is that it is invisible in the infrared region. Some theories have attempted to explain this by claiming that the outer temperature of the fur is the same as that of the environment. However, this explanation is unsatisfactory because surface radiation depends on both the surface temperature and the surface radiative properties [6].Copyright \u00ac\u00a9 2002 by ASME\",TRUE\nRadular teeth as models for the improvement of industrial cutting devices,\"Limpets (Gastropoda) and chitons (Polyplacophora) feed on epi- and endolithic organisms by means of the radula, a specialized feeding apparatus located in the mouth cavity. The radula owes most of its abrasive capability to the presence of numerous mineralized teeth. Here we report on the shape, internal structure, wearing pattern, feeding position, and distribution of hardness and elastic properties of these teeth in an attempt to generate ideas for the innovation of industrial cutting devices. The teeth remain sharp during their entire working-life mainly due to the fact that wearing preferentially occurs along surfaces formed by the internal structure of the tooth. It is shown that shape, internal structure, positioning and material characteristics\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "sciphi/triplex:latest", "temperature": 0.5, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 1024, "n": null}}
