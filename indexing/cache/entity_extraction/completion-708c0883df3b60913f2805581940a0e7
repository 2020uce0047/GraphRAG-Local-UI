Disease-suppressive soils are exceptional ecosystems in which crop plants suffer less from specific soil-borne pathogens than expected owing to the activities of other soil microorganisms. For most disease-suppressive soils, the microbes and mechanisms involved in pathogen control are unknown. By coupling PhyloChip-based metagenomics of the rhizosphere microbiome with culture-dependent functional analyses, we identified key bacterial taxa and genes involved in suppression of a fungal root pathogen. More than 33,000 bacterial and archaeal species were detected, with Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria consistently associated with disease suppression. Members of the \u0152\u2265-Proteobacteria were shown to have disease-suppressive activity governed by nonribosomal peptide synthetases. Our data indicate that upon attack by a fungal root pathogen, plants can exploit microbial consortia from soil for protection against infections.\",TRUE\n\"Deep supercooling, vitrification and limited survival to \u201a\u00c4\u00ec100\u00ac\u221eC in the Alaskan beetle Cucujus clavipes puniceus (Coleoptera: Cucujidae) larvae\",\"SUMMARY Larvae of the freeze-avoiding beetle Cucujus clavipes puniceus (Coleoptera: Cucujidae) in Alaska have mean supercooling points in winter of \u201a\u00c4\u00ec35 to \u201a\u00c4\u00ec42\u00ac\u221eC, with the lowest supercooling point recorded for an individual of \u201a\u00c4\u00ec58\u00ac\u221eC. We previously noted that some larvae did not freeze when cooled to \u201a\u00c4\u00ec80\u00ac\u221eC, and we speculated that these larvae vitrified. Here we present evidence through differential scanning calorimetry that C. c. puniceus larvae transition into a glass-like state at temperatures <\u201a\u00c4\u00ec58\u00ac\u221eC and can avoid freezing to at least \u201a\u00c4\u00ec150\u00ac\u221eC. This novel finding adds vitrification to the list of insect overwintering strategies. While overwintering beneath the bark of fallen trees, C. c. puniceus larvae may experience low ambient temperatures of around \u201a\u00c4\u00ec40\u00ac\u221eC (and lower) when microhabitat is un-insulated because of low snow cover. Decreasing temperatures in winter are correlated with loss of body water from summer high levels near 2\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "phi3:latest", "temperature": 0.5, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 8192, "n": null}}
