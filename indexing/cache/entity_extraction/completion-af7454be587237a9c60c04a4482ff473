{"result": " To determine the impact of a single genetic mutation on an organism, we must first understand what the mutation is and which gene it affects. Once identified, several approaches can be taken to assess its effect:\n\n1. Compare the phenotype (observable traits) between wild-type individuals without the mutation and those with the mutation in a controlled environment. Look for changes in physical characteristics, behavior, or overall fitness.\n2. Conduct molecular studies such as DNA sequencing to pinpoint where the mutation occurred within the gene of interest and predict potential consequences on protein function based on known biological databases or literature.\n3. Employ techniques like CRISPR/Cas9 for genome editing in model organisms that share similar genetic makeup, observing any phenotypic changes due to this targeted mutation.\n4. Perform biochemical assays to analyze the function of proteins produced by both wild-type and mutant alleles; enzyme activity or binding interactions may be altered.\n5. Use computational modeling tools for in silico predictions of the mutation's impact on protein structure and function, providing insight into potential changes at the molecular level.\n6. Crossbreeding organisms with and without the mutation can reveal information about its effect on offspring and inheritance patterns.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

Desert cactus with large photosynthetic stem surfaces had the highest temperatures and lowest transpiration rates. Perennial plants with relatively small leaves had moderate transpiration rates and leaf temperatures close to air temperature. Desert perennials with relatively large leaves had leaf temperatures well below air temperature along with the greatest accompanying transpiration rates of over 20 micrograms per square centimeter per second, but also had correspondingly low temperatures for maximum photosynthesis. The low leaf temperatures measured for these large-leafed species are an exception to the more common pattern for desert plants whereby a smaller leaf size prevents overheating and leads to reductions in transpiration and increased water-use efficiency. The contribution of a larger leaf size to a lower leaf temperature, and thus higher rate of photosynthesis for these large-leafed species, may represent an adaptive pattern previously unrecognized for desert plants.\"\nDISTRIBUTE_LIQUIDS,\"Control of the Selectivity of the Aquaporin Water Channel Family by Global Orientational Tuning Aquaporins are transmembrane channels found in cell membranes of all life forms. We examine their apparently paradoxical property, facilitation of efficient permeation of water while excluding protons, which is of critical importance to preserving the electrochemical potential across the cell membrane. We have determined the structure of the Escherichia coliaquaglyceroporin GlpF with bound water, in native (2.7 angstroms) and in W48F/F200T mutant (2.1 angstroms) forms, and carried out 12-nanosecond molecular dynamics simulations that define the spatial and temporal probability distribution and orientation of a single file of seven to nine water molecules inside the channel. Two conserved asparagines force a central water molecule to serve strictly as a hydrogen bond donor to its neighboring water molecules. Assisted by the electrostatic potential generated by two half-membrane spanning loops, this dictates opposite orientations of water molecules in the two halves of the channel, and thus prevents the formation of a \u201a\u00c4\u00faproton wire,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 while permitting rapid water diffusion.
