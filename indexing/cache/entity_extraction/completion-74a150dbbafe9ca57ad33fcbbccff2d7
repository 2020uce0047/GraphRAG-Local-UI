Flipper sections had a blunt, rounded leading edge and a highly tapered trailing edge. Placement of the maximum thickness placement for each cross\u201a\u00c4\u00easection varied from 49% of chord at the tip to 19% at mid\u201a\u00c4\u00easpan. Section thickness ratio averaged 0.23 with a range of 0.20\u201a\u00c4\u00ec0.28. The humpback whale flipper had a cross\u201a\u00c4\u00easectional design typical of manufactured aerodynamic foils for lift generation. The morphology and placement of leading edge tubercles sugges that they function as enhanced lift devices to control flow over the flipper and maintain lift at high angles of attack. The morphology of the humpback whale flipper suggests that it is adapted for high maneuverability associated with the whale's unique feeding behavior. \u00ac\u00a9 1995 Wiley\u201a\u00c4\u00eaLiss, Inc.\",TRUE\nHydrodynamic Trail-Following in Harbor Seals (Phoca vitulina),\"Marine mammals often forage in dark or turbid waters. Whereas dolphins use echolocation under such conditions, pinnipeds apparently lack this sensory ability. For seals hunting in the dark, one source of sensory information may consist of fish-generated water movements, which seals can detect with their highly sensitive whiskers. Water movements in the wake of fishes persist for several minutes. Here we show that blindfolded seals can use their whiskers to detect and accurately follow hydrodynamic trails generated by a miniature submarine. This shows that hydrodynamic information can be used for long-distance prey location.\",TRUE\nHydrodynamics of sailing of the Portuguese man-of-war Physalia physalis,\"Physalia physalis, commonly known as the Portuguese man-of-war (PMW), is a peculiar looking colony of specialized polyps. The most conspicuous members of this colony are the gas-filled sail-like float and the long tentacles, budding asymmetrically beneath the float. This study addresses the sailing of the PMW, and, in particular, the hydrodynamics of its trailing tentacles, the interaction between the tentacles and the float and the actual sailing performance.
