{"result": " To provide a user with information about the historical development and impact of nuclear energy, including key events in its timeline:\n  \nNuclear energy has had a significant influence on global power generation since the mid-20th century. Here's an overview of the critical milestones:\n\n1938 - Discovery of Nuclear Fission: German physicists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, along with Austrian chemist Lise Meitner, discovered nuclear fission, which became a key concept in developing nuclear energy. In this year, the possibility of releasing large amounts of energy from atomic nuclei was first realized by their experiments on uranium atoms.\n  \n1942 - Manhattan Project: During World War II, the U.S. government initiated the top-secret project to develop an atomic bomb due to fears that Nazi Germany might create one. This led to the development of nuclear power as a weapon and set the foundation for its later peaceful use in energy production.\n  \n1954 - The First Nuclear Power Plant: Experimental Breeder Reactor I (EBR-I) near Arco, Idaho became operational, demonstrating that it was possible to generate electricity from nuclear fission. It provided a proof of concept for peaceful use and began the era of commercial nuclear energy generation.\n  \n1957 - The First Commercial Nuclear Power Plant: Shippingport Atomic Power Station in Pennsylvania started operating, marking the beginning of commercial power production through nuclear technology.\n\n1960s - Expansion Era: Numerous plants were built around the world as countries sought alternative sources to fossil fuels amid growing energy needs and environmental concerns about pollution from coal and oil. The first large-scale plant, Calder Hall in England, came online in 1956, followed by a significant boom of nuclear power construction.\n  \n1970s - Nuclear Power Growth Peak: At its peak in the early '70s, more than one thousand reactors were planned or under construction worldwide. This was partly driven by oil crises and the push for energy independence.\n  \n1986 - Chernobyl Accident: The catastrophic failure of a nuclear reactor at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine raised concerns about safety, leading to widespread scrutiny on regulatory processes and public skepticism regarding nuclear power's safety.\n  \n1980s-Present - Stagnation & Renewed Interest: While some countries halted new reactor construction due to economic factors and heightened safety concerns, others continued developing advanced reactors with improved safety features or pursued nuclear energy as part of their low-carbon strategy. \n  \n2011 - Fukushima Daiichi Accident: This disaster caused by a tsunami following an earthquake led to Japan's temporary shutdown and reassessment of its nuclear program, along with heightened global scrutiny on nuclear energy's role in the face of renewable alternatives.\n  \nPresent & Future - Nuclear Energy Renaissance: Countries like China and Russia are actively building new reactors while others phase out their aging plants or decommission them; however, there is growing interest in Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) as a potentially safer alternative. Investment in nuclear energy research remains steady with advances in fusion technology being the ultimate goal for safe and clean power generation.\n  \nThroughout its history, the use of nuclear energy has been met with controversy due to concerns about safety, waste disposal, and environmental impacts. However, it also represents a significant portion of global low-carbon electricity production. The future will likely see further evolution of technology that addresses these concerns while meeting the growing demand for sustainable and reliable power sources.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

In this paper, we show that the animal uses the motions of its valves to locally fluidize the surrounding soil and reduce burrowing drag. Substrate deformations were measured using particle image velocimetry (PIV) in a novel visualization system that enabled us to see through the soil and watch E. directus burrow in situ. PIV data, supported by soil and fluid mechanics theory, show that contraction of the valves of E. directus locally fluidizes the surrounding soil. Particle and fluid mixtures can be modeled as a Newtonian fluid with an effective viscosity based on the local void fraction. Using these models, we demonstrate that E. directus is strong enough to reach full burrow depth in fluidized soil, but not in static soil. Furthermore, we show that the method of localized fluidization reduces the amount of energy required to reach burrow depth by an order of magnitude compared with penetrating static soil, and leads to a burrowing energy that scales linearly with depth rather than with depth squared.\"\nACTIVELY_MOVE_THROUGH/ON_SOLIDS,\"LOCOMOTOR PERFORMANCE AND ENERGETIC COST OF SIDEWINDING BY THE SNAKE CROTALUS CERASTES We measured the performance (burst speed and endurance) and the energetic cost of sidewinding locomotion for the viperid snake Crotalus cerastes. The linear scaling regressions relating log mass to log burst speed and log endurance have slopes of 0.29 and 1.01, respectively. Maximal burst speed observed for an individual snake (SVL=41.9cm, SVL is snout-vent length) was3.7kmh\u201a\u00e0\u00ed1. Adult snakes were able to match a tread speed of 0.5 km h\u201a\u00e0\u00ed1 for times ranging from 33 to more than 180 min, and at 0.7kmh\u201a\u00e0\u00ed1 endurance times ranged from 9 to 52 min. Rates of oxygen consumption increased linearly over a range of aerobically sustainable speeds (0.28\u201a\u00c4\u00ec0.50\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "phi3:latest", "temperature": 0.5, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 8192, "n": null}}
