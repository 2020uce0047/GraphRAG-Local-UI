It was difficult to distinguish single cell bodies within groups by fluorescence. The inhibitors cytochalasin B and D stop the movement of cell bodies and network. Myosin is present in the cortical region of each cell body, and the central portions of each individual cell body contain accumulations of this protein. We could not observe any fluorescence in the network after myosin staining with the antibodies we used. An actin-myosin complex is probably responsible for the sliding movement of cell bodies in the Labyrinthula network, because actin is found in the pseudopodia-like tubes, and the cortex of the cell bodies is rich in actin and myosin. This actin-myosin complex seems to differ from another actin-myosin complex that has been postulated to be responsible for the locomotion of pseudopodia-like tubes. We propose that two actin-myosin complexes exist. One of them is responsible for locomotory phenomena of the network, and the second for cell body sliding in the pseudopodia-like tubes. In each case the myosin is probably anchored in the inner matrix membrane of the pseudopodia-like tubes. A model for actin-myosin interaction inLabyrinthula spp. is presented.\"\nCOOPERATE_WITHIN/BETWEEN_SPECIES|COORDINATE_BY_SELF-ORGANIZATION|DISTRIBUTE_LIQUIDS|DISTRIBUTE_SOLIDS,\"Food dissemination in ants: robustness of the trophallactic network against resource quality ABSTRACT Insect societies are often composed of many individuals, achieving collective decisions that depend on environmental and colonial characteristics. For example, ants are able to focus their foraging effort on the most rewarding food source. While this phenomenon is well known, the link between the food source quality and the intranidal food dissemination networks and its dynamics has been neglected. Here, we analysed the global dynamics of food dissemination in Camponotus cruentatus workers, after feeding on a low (0.1\u201a\u00c4\u00d6mol\u201a\u00c4\u00d6l\u201a\u00e0\u00ed1) or on a high (1\u201a\u00c4\u00d6mol\u201a\u00c4\u00d6l\u201a\u00e0\u00ed1) sucrose concentration food source. We also analysed the trophallaxis activity at the individual level and built the complete network of trophallaxis. The results reveal that the dynamics of food dissemination and the structure of the trophallaxis network are robust and independent of the food concentration. We discuss these results in\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "phi3:latest", "temperature": 0.5, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 8192, "n": null}}
