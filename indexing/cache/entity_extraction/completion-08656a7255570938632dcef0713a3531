{"result": " The primary factors contributing to the formation of tropical cyclones include:\n\n1. Warm sea surface temperatures: Tropical cyclones typically form over large bodies of warm water with a temperature exceeding 26.5\u00b0C (80\u00b0F). This high sea surface temperature provides the necessary heat and moisture for the storm to develop and intensify. The energy derived from the warm ocean acts as fuel for these systems, contributing to their development.\n\n2. Low vertical wind shear: Wind shear refers to a change in wind speed or direction with increasing altitude. Tropical cyclones require an environment of low vertical wind shear, which means that winds at different levels do not vary dramatically from the surface level up through the troposphere. High wind shear can disrupt the organization of the storm and weaken it by tugging on its structure in opposite directions.\n  \n3. Sufficient Coriolis effect: The Coriolis force is essential for cyclone rotation, as it creates a spinning motion within the system that helps develop into a hurricane or typhoon. This phenomenon is more pronounced farther from the equator and less prominent nearer to it since the Coriolis effect depends on latitude\u2014it's virtually nonexistent at the Equator, but increases with distance from the equator.\n\n4. High humidity levels in the mid-troposphere: A moist environment throughout the atmosphere promotes condensation and thunderstorm development necessary to form the strong convection currents that drive tropical cyclones. This high humidity level helps maintain a stable column of air, allowing for efficient energy transfer from the ocean surface upwards through the system.\n  \n5. A pre-existing weather disturbance: Tropical cyclones usually develop out of disturbances like low-pressure areas or tropical waves that can provide an initial source of spinning motion and a mechanism to consolidate thunderstorm activity, setting off the cycle of convection needed for their development.\n\n6. Outflow pattern conducive for storm intensification: An upper-level outflow allows hot air to escape at the top of the cyclone system, effectively \"ventilating\" the storm and aiding in its growth by allowing more warm moist air from below to rise into the atmosphere. This creates a feedback loop wherein as thunderstorm activity increases near the center, it draws up even more air, further strengthening the low-pressure area at sea level which fuels the cyclone's formation and intensification.\n", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

The herons' striking of prey, while their approach angle was restricted, was observed. (a) The herons' capture success in the restricted situation was markedly lower than in the unrestricted situation. (b) The points of strike (STR) in unsuccessful strikes differed from those of successful strikes, and from those of the unrestricted situation. (c) The larger the difference between the observed and the predicted ratio of prey depth to apparent prey depth, the higher the probability of missing a prey. These results support predictions of a model presented elsewhere (Katzir and Intrator 1987) that a heron will attempt to reach spatial positions at which prey's real depth and apparent depth are linearly correlated.\"\nSENSE_LIGHT_IN_THE_VISIBLE_SPECTRUM,\"The mechanism of floral heliotropism in the snow buttercup, Ranunculus adoneus ABSTRACT We designed field experiments using solar-trackingRanunculus adoneusflowers to determine where photo-reception occurred, which organs responded, and howmovement was achieved. Flower peduncles bend eastwardin the morning and gradually unbend over the course ofthe day. Peduncles were found to bend significantly morefrequently in the middle region near the floral bracts,1\u201a\u00c4\u00ec3 cm below the flower, than elsewhere on the peduncle.Because the peduncle tip continued to track the sun evenafter the flower itself was removed, our experiments con-centrated on shielding (or conversely, exposing) variousportions of peduncles from (or to) sunlight. Photo-reception occurred primarily in the portion of the stemjust beneath the floral receptacle. By following the posi-tion of landmarks applied to the stem, we found that 40%more growth occurred on the shaded side of bent pedun-cles, compared to the sunlit side. In contrast, top-shieldedpeduncles did not solar track well and grew only 25%more on the shaded side than on the sunlit side. Thisgrowth differential corresponded to differences in celllength on the two sides of bent peduncles, with signifi-cantly longer epidermal cells occurring on the shaded sidethan on the sunlit side.Key-words: Ranunculus adoneus; snow buttercup; helio-tropism; phototropism; solar tracking.\"\nSENSE_LIGHT_IN\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "phi3:latest", "temperature": 0.5, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 8192, "n": null}}
