The teeth remain sharp during their entire working-life mainly due to the fact that wearing preferentially occurs along surfaces formed by the internal structure of the tooth. It is shown that shape, internal structure, positioning and material characteristics concertedly function in minimizing the rate at which the teeth wear down and in maintaining optimal cutting behaviour. Implementation of these self-sharpening characteristics into industrial cutting devices is discussed.\",TRUE\nRapid increase of vacuolar volume in response to salt stress,\"Abstract. Suspension-cultured cells of mangrove [Bruguiera sexangula (Lour.) Poir.] showed a rapid increase in vacuolar volume under salt stress, although there was no change in the cell volume. The rapid increase in the vacuolar volume was an active process, which followed the activation of the tonoplast H+-ATPase and the vacuolar acid phosphatase. The same phenomenon was observed in barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Doriru) root meristematic cells under salt stress but not in pea (Pisum sativum L.). Increases in vacuolar volume could potentially protect the cytoplasm by decreasing the cytoplasmic volume during the initial phases of salt stress.\",TRUE\nRapid self-assembly of complex biomolecular architectures during mussel byssus biofabrication,\"Protein-based biogenic materials provide important inspiration for the development of high-performance polymers. The fibrous mussel byssus, for instance, exhibits exceptional wet adhesion, abrasion resistance, toughness and self-healing capacity\u201a\u00c4\u00ecproperties that arise from an intricate hierarchical organization formed in minutes from a fluid secretion of over 10 different protein precursors. However, a poor understanding of this dynamic biofabrication process has hindered effective translation of byssus design principles into synthetic materials. Here, we explore mussel byssus assembly in Mytilus edulis using a synergistic combination of histological staining and confocal Raman microspectroscopy, enabling in situ tracking of specific proteins during induced thread formation from soluble precursors to solid fibres. Our findings reveal critical insights into this complex biological manufacturing process, showing that protein precursors spontaneously self-assemble into complex architectures, while maturation proceeds in subsequent regulated steps. Beyond their biological importance, these findings may guide development of advanced materials with biomedical and industrial relevance.\",TRUE\nRaptorial jaws in the throat help\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "phi3:latest", "temperature": 0.5, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 8192, "n": null}}
