{"result": " Based on your request for a more efficient workflow, I would suggest the following steps:\n\n1. **Task Prioritization**: Start by identifying and categorizing tasks based on their urgency and importance using techniques like the Eisenhower Matrix which helps distinguish between what is important versus what appears to be urgent but might not have significant long-term impacts. This will allow you to focus on high priority activities first, increasing your productivity.\n \n2. **Time Blocking**: Allocate specific time slots for different tasks in your calendar. This helps minimize distractions and keeps you focused on one task at a time which can drastically improve efficiency.\n \n3. **Implement the Pomodoro Technique**: Work for 25 minutes straight, then take a 5-minute break. The idea is to keep your mind fresh and more productive throughout the day by ensuring regular breaks from work.\n\n4. **Limit multitasking**: Multitasking often reduces efficiency as it splits attention amongst various tasks. Try focusing on one task at a time instead. \n\n5. **Use Productivity Tools**: Utilize tools such as Trello or Asana to keep track of your progress and stay organized. These tools also allow for collaboration, making team projects more manageable.\n\n6. **Delegation**: Delegate tasks that do not require your direct intervention to others who have the skills and time. This allows you to focus on high-level strategic activities.\n\nRemember to periodically reevaluate and adjust these methods based on what works best for you as everyone's workflow is unique!", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

These tissues are supplied by circulatory, neural and tracheal systems throughout the adult lifetime, indicating that the insect wing is a dynamic, living structure. Behavioral assays show that butterflies use wings to sense visible and infrared radiation, responding with specialized behaviors to prevent overheating of their wings. Our work highlights the physiological importance of wing temperature and how it is exquisitely regulated by structural and behavioral adaptations. Butterfly wings have low thermal capacity and thus are vulnerable to damage by overheating. Here, Tsai et al. take an interdisciplinary approach to reveal the organs, nanostructures and behaviors that enable butterflies to sense and regulate their wing temperature.\",TRUE\nPhysical limits of flight performance in the heaviest soaring bird,\"Significance Flapping flight is extremely costly for large birds, yet little is known about the conditions that force them to flap. We attached custom-made \u201a\u00c4\u00faflight recorders\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 to Andean condors, the world\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s heaviest soaring birds, documenting every single wingbeat and when and how individuals gained altitude. Remarkably, condors flapped for only 1% of their flight time, specifically during takeoff and when close to the ground. This is particularly striking as the birds were immature. Thus, our results demonstrate that even inexperienced birds can cover vast distances over land without flapping. Overall, this can help explain how extinct birds with twice the wingspan of condors could have flown. Flight costs are predicted to vary with environmental conditions, and this should ultimately determine the movement capacity and distributions of large soaring birds. Despite this, little is known about how flight effort varies with environmental parameters. We deployed bio-logging devices on the world\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s heaviest soaring bird, the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus), to assess the extent to which these birds can operate without resorting to powered flight. Our records of individual wingbeats in >216 h of flight show that condors can sustain soaring across a wide range of wind and thermal conditions, flapping for only 1% of their flight time. This is among the very lowest estimated movement costs in vertebrates. One bird even flew for >5 h without flapping, covering \u201a\u00e0\u00ba172 km. Overall, > 75% of flapping flight was associated with takeoffs. Movement between weak thermal updrafts at the start of the day also imposed a metabolic cost, with birds flapping toward the end of glides to reach ephemeral thermal updrafts.
