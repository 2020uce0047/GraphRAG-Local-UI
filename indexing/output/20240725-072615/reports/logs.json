These mounds vary geographically in mean orientation in a manner that suggests such variation is an adaptive response to local environmental conditions. Theoretical modelling of solar irradiance and mound rotation experiments show that maintenance of an eastern face temperature plateau during the dry season is the most likely physical basis for the mound orientation response. Subsequent heat transfer analysis shows that habitat wind speed and shading conditions also affect face temperature gradients such as the rate of eastern face temperature change. It is then demonstrated that the geographic variation in mean mound orientation follows the geographic variation in long-term wind speed and shading conditions across northern Australia such that an eastern face temperature plateau is maintained in all locations.,TRUE\n2.

Computer simulations of the neuron have been developed and have demonstrated the ability of mobile robots, interfaced with a simulated LGMD model, to avoid collisions. In this study, a model of the LGMD neuron is presented and the functional parameters of the model identified. Models with different parameters were presented with a range of automotive video sequences, including collisions with cars. The parameters were optimised to respond correctly to the video sequences using a range of genetic algorithms (GAs). The model evolved most rapidly using GAs with high clone rates into a form suitable for detecting collisions with cars and not producing false collision alerts to most non-collision scenes.\",TRUE\nA Biological Screw in a Beetle\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Leg,Joints on the legs of weevils form a functional screw-and-nut system.

A variant of this problem is solved during the development of the fly\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s nervous system, when sensory organ precursor (SOP) cells are chosen. By studying SOP selection, we derived a fast algorithm for MIS selection that combines two attractive features. First, processors do not need to know their degree; second, it has an optimal message complexity while only using one-bit messages. Our findings suggest that simple and efficient algorithms can be developed on the basis of biologically derived insights.\",TRUE\nA biological sub-micron thickness optical broadband reflector characterized using both light and microwaves,\"Broadband optical reflectors generally function through coherent scattering from systems comprising one of three designs: overlapped; chirped; or chaotic multilayer reflectors. For each, the requirement to scatter a broad band of wavelengths is met through the presence of a variation in nanostructural periodicity running perpendicular to the systems' outer surfaces. Consequently, the requisite total thickness of the multilayer can often be in excess of 50\u201a\u00c4\u00e4\u0152\u00bam. Here, we report the discovery and the microwave-assisted characterization of a natural system that achieves excellent optical broadband reflectivity but that is less than 1\u201a\u00c4\u00e4\u0152\u00bam thick. This system, found on the wing scales of the butterfly Argyrophorus argenteus, comprises a distinctive variation in periodicity that runs parallel to the reflecting surface, rather than perpendicular to it. In this way, the requirement for an extensively thick system is removed.\",TRUE\nA branched material based on biomimetic design: Synthesis and electrochemical properties,\"Based on the biomimetic route the metal material with tree-like fractal structure was prepared, which showed a rough surface observed by scanning electron\n######################\noutput:"}}

All rights reserved.\",TRUE\nA buckling region in locust hindlegs contains resilin and absorbs energy when jumping or kicking goes wrong,\"If a hindleg of a locust slips during jumping, or misses its target during kicking, energy generated by the two extensor tibiae muscles is no longer expended in raising the body or striking a target. How, then, is the energy in a jump (4100\u201a\u00c4\u00ec4800 \u0152\u00baJ) or kick (1700 \u0152\u00baJ) dissipated? A specialised buckling region found in the proximal hind-tibia where the bending moment is high, but not present in the other legs, buckled and allowed the distal part of the tibia to extend. In jumps when a hindleg slipped, it bent by a mean of 23\u00ac\u00b114 deg at a velocity of 13.4\u00ac\u00b19.5 deg ms\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1; in kicks that failed to contact a target it bent by 32\u00ac\u00b116 deg at a velocity of 32.9\u00ac\u00b19.5 deg ms\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1. It also buckled 8.5\u00ac\u00b14.0 deg at a rate of 0.063\u00ac\u00b10.005 deg ms\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1 when the tibia was prevented from flexing fully about the femur in preparation for both these movements. By experimentally buckling this region through 40 deg at velocities of 0.001\u201a\u00c4\u00ec0.65 deg ms\u201a\u00c4\u00ec1, we showed that one hindleg could store about 870 \u0152\u00baJ on bending, of which 210 \u0152\u00baJ was dissipated back to the leg on release. A band of blue fluorescence was revealed at the buckling region under UV illumination that had the two key signatures of the elastic protein resilin\n######################\noutput:"}}

One potential solution to this problem is the use of antibiotics in combination with resistance-modifying agents, compounds that act synergistically with existing antibiotics to resensitize previously resistant bacteria. In this study, 12(S),16\u0152\u00e6-dihydroxycleroda-3,13-dien-15,16-olide, a clerodane diterpene isolated from the medicinal plant Callicarpa americana, was found to synergize with oxacillin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. This synergy was confirmed by checkerboard (FICI = 0.125) and time-kill assays, with a sub-inhibitory dose of 12(S),16\u0152\u00e6-dihydroxycleroda-3,13-dien-15,16-olide causing the effective concentration of oxacillin to fall below the susceptibility breakpoint for S. aureus, a > 32-fold decrease in both cases.\",TRUE\nA conserved spider silk domain acts as a molecular switch that controls fibre assembly,\"A huge variety of proteins are able to form fibrillar structures, especially at high protein concentrations.

This makes the lipid layers more ordered and creates a tighter barrier against water vapor diffusion, reducing water loss.\n\n2. **Mountain Pine Beetle Flight and Host Colonization**\n   - Female mountain pine beetles that fly longer distances and lose more body mass during flight are less likely to colonize new hosts (trees) but produce more aggregation pheromone.\n   - Male beetles' production of attraction pheromone is affected by their condition after flying, not the energy used during flight.\n   - This variation in flight behavior helps maintain population levels by balancing safe and risky host colonization strategies.\n\n3. **Piezoelectric Scaffold for Adaptive Bone Tissue Engineering**\n   - A new material system is developed that can adapt its mechanical properties in response to external stress.\n   - Piezoelectric scaffolds generate charges when stressed, which induce mineralization from surrounding media, reinforcing regions of high stress or damaged areas.\n   - This self-regenerating material could help address challenges in load-bearing applications by adapting to changing stress conditions.\n\n4. **Daily Variation of UV-Protective Compounds in Marine Dinoflagellate**\n   - The marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae increases its production of UV-absorbing compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids) when exposed to high photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) or PAR plus ultraviolet radiation (UVR).\n   - These compounds help protect the dinoflagellate from UV damage.\n\n5. **Termite Mounds as Passive Ventilation Systems**\n   - Termite mounds in different environments use periodic solar heating to drive internal ventilation, functioning like an external lung for the colony.\n   - Despite differences in gas stratification and overturning patterns, termite architectures can harness solar energy to facilitate gas exchange, with implications for human engineering. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

Silk proteins are reminiscent of amphiphilic block copolymers containing stretches of polyalanine and glycine-rich polar elements forming a repetitive core flanked by highly conserved non-repetitive amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal domains. The N-terminal domain comprises a secretion signal, but further functions remain unassigned. The C-terminal domain was implicated in the control of solubility and fibre formation initiated by changes in ionic composition and mechanical stimuli known to align the repetitive sequence elements and promote \u0152\u2264-sheet formation. However, despite recent structural data, little is known about this remarkable behaviour in molecular detail. Here we present the solution structure of the C-terminal domain of a spider dragline silk protein and provide evidence that the structural state of this domain is essential for controlled switching between the storage and assembly forms of silk proteins. In addition, the C-terminal domain also has a role in the alignment of secondary structural features formed by the repetitive elements in the backbone of spider silk proteins, which is known to be important for the mechanical properties of the fibre.\",TRUE\nA Cultured Greigite-Producing Magnetotactic Bacterium in a Novel Group of Sulfate-Reducing Bacteria,\"The crystal structure of biomineralized magnetic nanocrystals depends on environmental and genetic factors.

We isolated a greigite-producing magnetotactic bacterium from a brackish spring in Death Valley National Park, California, USA, strain BW-1, that is able to biomineralize greigite and magnetite depending on culture conditions. A phylogenetic comparison of BW-1 and similar uncultured greigite- and/or magnetite-producing magnetotactic bacteria from freshwater to hypersaline habitats shows that these organisms represent a previously unknown group of sulfate-reducing bacteria in the Deltaproteobacteria. Genomic analysis of BW-1 reveals the presence of two different magnetosome gene clusters, suggesting that one may be responsible for greigite biomineralization and the other for magnetite.\",TRUE\nA dinoflagellate exploits toxins to immobilize prey prior to ingestion,\"Toxins produced by the harmful algal bloom (HAB) forming, mixotrophic dinoflagellate\n######################\noutput:"}}

To date, the perceived ecological role for toxins has been relief from grazing pressures. Here, we demonstrate that karlotoxins also serve as a predation instrument. Using high-speed holographic microscopy, we measure the swimming behavior of several toxic and nontoxic strains of K. veneficum and their prey, Storeatula major, within dense suspensions. The selected strains produce toxins with varying potency and dosages, including a nontoxic one. Results clearly show that mixing the prey with the predatory, toxic strains causes prey immobilization at rates that are consistent with the karlotoxins\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 potency and dosage. Even prey cells that continue swimming slow down after exposure to toxic predators. The swimming characteristics of predators vary substantially in pure suspensions, as quantified by their velocity, radii of helical trajectories, and direction of helical rotation. When mixed with prey, all toxic strains that are involved in predation slow down. Furthermore, they substantially reduced their predominantly vertical migration, presumably to remain in the vicinity of their prey. Conversely, the nontoxic control strain does not alter its swimming and does not affect prey behavior. In separate experiments, we show that exposing prey to exogenous toxins also causes prey immobilization at rates consistent with potency. Clearly, the toxic predatory strains use karlotoxins as a means of stunning their prey, before ingesting it. These findings add a substantiated critical understanding for why some HAB species produce such complex toxin molecules.\",TRUE\nA dynamic broadband reflector built from microscopic silica spheres in the \u201a\u00c4\u00f2disco\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 clam Ctenoides ales,\"The \u201a\u00c4\u00f2disco\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 or \u201a\u00c4\u00f2electric\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 clam Ctenoides ales (Limidae) is the only species of bivalve known to have a behaviourally mediated photic display.

The scheme is implemented by embedding muscle fibers in finite elements. In any given element, the fiber orientation can be assigned arbitrarily and multiple muscle directions can be simulated. The mechanical stress in each muscle fiber is the sum of active and passive parts. The active stress is taken to be a function of activation state, muscle fiber shortening velocity and fiber strain; while the passive stress depends only on the strain. This scheme is tested by simulating extension of a squid tentacle during prey capture; our numerical predictions are in close correspondence with existing experimental results. It is shown that the present finite element scheme can successfully simulate more complex behaviors such as torsion of a squid tentacle and the bending behavior of octopus arms or elephant trunks.\",TRUE\nA functional interpretation of cilia and mucocyte distributions on the abfrontal surface of bivalve gills,\"Abstract The lack of fundamental data on the abfrontal surface of bivalve gills has prompted a comparative study of cilia and mucocytes on this surface, using scanning electron microscopy and histology on eight species of bivalves, representing seven families and the four major gill types: Mytilus edulis, Modiolus modiolus, Arca zebra, Placopecten magellanicus, Crassostrea virginica, Spisula solidissima, Mercenaria mercenaria, and Mya arenaria.

Abfrontal cilia and mucocytes were found in all species studied, with types and densities differing within and between gill types. The three species of homorhabdic filibranchs presented different densities of abfrontal cilia and mucocytes, from very dense in M. edulis to sparse in A. zebra. The heterorhabdic gills had intermediate cilia and mucocyte densities, with highest concentrations of both abfrontal cilia and mucocytes on the principal filaments. The eulamellibranchs showed low ciliary densities together with high mucocyte densities, especially in S. solidissima, where the abfrontal mucocytes were glandular. These results indicate that: (1) the abfrontal surface is a vestigial mucociliary surface; (2) the abfrontal surface cannot participate in water pumping in most species, due to low ciliary densities; and (3) species with high densities of abfrontal mucocytes could utilize abfrontal mucus to reduce drag, especially in the highly fused gills, such as those of the eulamellibranchs. The differing distributions of abfrontal cilia and mucocytes may reflect different selective pressures acting on the gills within the various taxa.\",TRUE\nA honey bee odorant receptor for the queen substance 9-oxo-2-decenoic acid,\"By using a functional genomics approach, we have identified a honey bee [Apis mellifera (Am)] odorant receptor (Or) for the queen substance 9-oxo-2-decenoic acid (9-ODA). Honey bees live in large eusocial colonies in which a single queen is responsible for reproduction, several thousand sterile female worker bees complete a myriad of tasks to maintain the colony, and several hundred male drones exist only to mate. The \u201a\u00c4\u00faqueen substance\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 [also termed the queen retinue pheromone (QRP)] is an eight-component pheromone that maintains the queen's dominance in the colony. The main component, 9-ODA, acts as a releaser pheromone by attracting workers to the queen and as a primer pheromone by physiologically inhibiting worker ovary development; it also acts as a sex pheromone, attracting drones\n######################\noutput:"}}

However, the extent to which social and sexual chemical messages are shared remains unresolved. By using a custom chemosensory-specific microarray and qPCR, we identified four candidate sex pheromone Ors (AmOr10, -11, -18, and -170) from the honey bee genome based on their biased expression in drone antennae. We assayed the pheromone responsiveness of these receptors by using Xenopus oocytes and electrophysiology. AmOr11 responded specifically to 9-ODA (EC50 = 280 \u00ac\u00b1 31 nM) and not to any of the other seven QRP components, other social pheromones, or floral odors. We did not observe any responses of the other three Ors to any of the eight QRP pheromone components, suggesting 9-ODA is the only QRP component that also acts as a long-distance sex pheromone.\",TRUE\n\"A lightweight, biological structure with tailored stiffness: The feather vane.\",\"UNLABELLEDThe flying feathers of birds are keratinous appendages designed for maximum performance with a minimum weight penalty. Thus, their design contains ingenious combinations of components that optimize lift, stiffness, aerodynamics, and damage resistance. This design involves two main parts: a central shaft that prescribes stiffness and lateral vanes which allows for the capture of air. Within the feather vane, barbs branch from the shaft and barbules branch from barbs, forming a flat surface which ensures lift. Microhooks at the end of barbules hold barbs tightly together, providing the close-knit, unified structure of the feather vane and enabling a repair of the structure through the reattachment of un-hooked junctions. Both the shaft and barbs are lightweight biological structures constructed of keratin using the common motif of a solid shell and cellular interior. The cellular core increases the resistance to buckling with little added weight. Here we analyze the detailed structure of the feather barb and, for the first time, explain its flexural stiffness in terms of the mechanics of asymmetric foam-filled beams subjected to bending. The results are correlated and validated with finite element modeling\n######################\noutput:"}}

It is shown that the iridescent scales present in the rainbow-hued spots are due to a 3D photonic crystal network of chitin in air with a single diamond (Fd-3m) symmetry. In many insects, different orientations of photonic crystal domains are used to create various hues. In this weevil, however, both the chitin volume fractions as well as the lattice parameters of the biologically self-assembled single diamond nanostructure are varied to achieve the remarkable tuning of the structural colors across the visible light spectrum on a scale-by-scale basis. Uncovering the precise mechanism of color tuning employed by this weevil has important implications for further structural and developmental research on biophotonic nanostructures and may provide fresh impetus for bioinspired and biomimetic multifunctional applications, as synthesis of photonic crystals at visible length scales is currently challenging.\",TRUE\nA method for characterizing and mimicking forest canopy gaps caused by different disturbances,\"Forest canopy gaps are measurable indicators of past small-scale disturbances. These disturbances can impact forest stand dynamics in ways that help maintain and enhance many ecosystem values. Impacts are commonly assessed using timber production metrics based on average stand values, but metrics based on smaller scales are needed to assess impacts on nontimber resources. In this study, we developed a multivariate method of quantitatively characterizing individual canopy gaps in Douglas-fir/grand fir stands in the Blue Mountains of eastern Oregon. We then established a reference or target range of variability by profiling gaps according to numbers of snags, downed logs, gap size and shape, and recolonizing vegetation. Cluster analysis, multidimensional scaling, and classification trees were used with these profiles to quantify similarity among individual gaps. Gaps fell into four groups, which could be interpreted as three ecologically functional groups on the basis of their role in stand development. Gaps caused by the same agents commonly fell within the same functional group: (1) flooding, logging, spruce budworm, and windfall cause stand level impacts that reset the stand development sequence; (2) bark beetles, tree fall, and root diseases cause within stand impacts that altered the rate of stand development; and (3) stem decay and dwarf mistletoe, and, under some circumstances, all disturbance agents, could kill trees yet have no impact on stand development except create space into which\n######################\noutput:"}}

However, recent data show that the amount of protein damage caused during irradiation of bacteria is better related to survival than to DNA damage. In this Opinion article, a new model is presented in which proteins are the most important target in the hierarchy of macromolecules affected by IR. A first line of defence against IR in extremely radiation-resistant bacteria might be the accumulation of manganese complexes, which can prevent the production of iron-dependent reactive oxygen species. This would allow an irradiated cell to protect sufficient enzymatic activity needed to repair DNA and survive.\",TRUE\n\"A nocturnal mammal, the greater mouse-eared bat, calibrates a magnetic compass by the sun\",\"Recent evidence suggests that bats can detect the geomagnetic field, but the way in which this is used by them for navigation to a home roost remains unresolved. The geomagnetic field may be used by animals both to indicate direction and to locate position. In birds, directional information appears to be derived from an interaction of the magnetic field with either the sun or the stars, with some evidence suggesting that sunset/sunrise provides the primary directional reference by which a magnetic compass is calibrated daily. We demonstrate that homing greater mouse-eared bats (Myotis myotis) calibrate a magnetic compass with sunset cues by testing their homing response after exposure to an altered magnetic field at and after sunset. Magnetic manipulation at sunset resulted in a counterclockwise shift in orientation compared with controls, consistent with sunset calibration of the magnetic field, whereas magnetic manipulation after sunset resulted in no change in orientation.

Although all previously described TH-producing biomolecules are proteins, most thermal hysteresis factors (THFs) have not yet been structurally characterized, and none have been characterized from a freeze-tolerant animal. We isolated a highly active THF from the freeze-tolerant beetle, Upis ceramboides, by means of ice affinity. Amino acid chromatographic analysis, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, UV-Vis spectrophotometry, and NMR spectroscopy indicated that the THF contained little or no protein, yet it produced 3.7 \u00ac\u00b1 0.3 \u00ac\u221eC of TH at 5 mg/ml, comparable to that of the most active insect antifreeze proteins.

The cellular core increases the resistance to buckling with little added weight. Here we analyze the detailed structure of the feather barb and, for the first time, explain its flexural stiffness in terms of the mechanics of asymmetric foam-filled beams subjected to bending. The results are correlated and validated with finite element modeling. We compare the flexure of single barbs as well as arrays of barbs and find that the interlocking adherence of barbs to one another enables a more robust structure due to minimized barb rotation during deflection. Thus, the flexure behavior of the feather vane can be tailored by the adhesive hooking between barbs, creating a system that mitigates damage. A simplified three-dimensional physical model for this interlocking mechanism is constructed by additive manufacturing. The exceptional architecture of the feather vane will motivate the design of bioinspired structures with tailored and unique properties ranging from adhesives to aerospace materials.STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEDespite its importance to bird flight, literature characterizing the feather vane is extremely limited. The feather vane is composed of barbs that branch from the main shaft (rachis) and barbules that branch from barbs. In this study, the flexural behavior of the feather barb and the role of barbule connections in reinforcing the feather vane are quantitatively investigated for the first time, both experimentally and theoretically. Through the performed experiments, structure-function relationships within the feather vane are uncovered. Additionally, in the proposed model the sophisticated structure of the barbs and the interlocking mechanism of the feather vane are simplified to understand these processes in order to engineer new lightweight structures and adhesives.\",TRUE\nA Literal Elytral Rainbow: Tunable Structural Colors Using Single Diamond Biophotonic Crystals in Pachyrrhynchus congestus Weevils.,\"The brilliant colors of many insects arise from the interference of incident light with complex nanostructured biomaterials that are present in their cuticle.

Although tensilin converts the state of the dermis from soft to standard, it cannot convert from standard to stiff. In this study, we isolated and partially purified a novel stiffening factor from the dermis of Holothuria leucospilota. The factor stiffened the dermis in normal artificial sea water (ASW) but did not stiffen the soft dermis in Ca2+-free ASW. It also stiffened the dermis that had been converted to the standard state in Ca2+-free ASW by the action of tensilin. These results suggest that the factor produces the stiff dermis from the standard state but cannot work as a stiffener on the soft dermis. Its addition to longitudinal muscles of the sea cucumber produced no effects, suggesting that its effect is specific to the catch connective tissue.

This article investigates the structural development and morphology of these adhesive pads and aims to understand the underlying structure-function relationship of the attachment process. Based on our results, we discuss possible mechanical consequences of the tendril structure and compare our findings with similar attachment systems in unrelated species in order to identify general strategies of this mode of attachment. Methodology.\u201a\u00c4\u00c9We investigated the temporal development of the attachment process, including detailed studies of the morphology and anatomy of the adhesive pads, using LM with different staining procedures and SEM. Pivotal results.\u201a\u00c4\u00c9Young tendrils establish initial contact with a supporting substrate by interlocking with their hook-shaped tips. Touch stimuli induce the tips to develop into adhesive pads by callus-like growth of papillate epidermal cells. Fully grown pads are hemispherical on flat substrates or completely fill out larger cavities of the substrate. By apical cell division, the pad tissue perfectly mimics the microtopography of the substrate and also grows into minute gaps and fissures, establishing firm anchorage by optimal form closure.

The tube-building corophioid amphipod Crassicorophium bonellii produces from its legs fibrous, adhesive underwater threads that combine barnacle cement biology with aspects of spider silk thread extrusion spinning. We characterised the filamentous silk as a mixture of mucopolysaccharides and protein deriving from glands representing two distinct types. The carbohydrate and protein silk secretion is dominated by complex \u0152\u2264-sheet structures and a high content of charged amino acid residues. The filamentous secretion product exits the gland through a pore near the tip of the secretory leg after having moved through a duct, which subdivides into several small ductules all terminating in a spindle-shaped chamber. This chamber communicates with the exterior and may be considered the silk reservoir and processing/mixing space, in which the silk is mechanically and potentially chemically altered and becomes fibrous. We assert that further study of this probably independently evolved, marine arthropod silk processing and secretion system can provide not only important insights into the more complex arachnid and insect silks but also into crustacean adhesion cements.\",TRUE\nA novel stiffening factor inducing the stiffest state of holothurian catch connective tissue,\"SUMMARY The dermis of sea cucumbers is a catch connective tissue or mutable collagenous tissue that shows large changes in stiffness. Extensive studies on the dermis revealed that it can adopt three different states having different mechanical properties that can be reversibly converted. These are the stiff, standard and soft states. The standard state is readily produced when a dermal piece is immersed in the sea water containing Ca2+, whereas the soft state can be produced by removal of Ca2+. A stiffening protein, tensilin, has been isolated from some sea cucumbers (Cucumaria frondosa and Holothuria leucospilota). Although tensilin converts the state of the dermis from soft to standard, it cannot convert from standard to stiff. In this study, we isolated and partially purified a novel stiffening factor from the dermis of Holothuria leucospilota. The factor stiffened\n######################\noutput:"}}

Evarcha culicivora is an East African jumping spider (Salticidae) that feeds indirectly on vertebrate blood by selecting blood-carrying female mosquitoes as preferred prey. Methodology/Principal Findings By testing with motionless lures made from mounting dead insects in lifelike posture on cork discs, we show that E. culicivora selects Anopheles mosquitoes in preference to other mosquitoes and that this predator can identify Anopheles by static appearance alone. Tests using active (grooming) virtual mosquitoes rendered in 3-D animation show that Anopheles' characteristic resting posture is an important prey-choice cue for E. culicivora. Expression of the spider's preference for Anopheles varies with the spider's size, varies with its prior feeding condition and is independent of the spider gaining a blood meal. Conclusions/Significance This is the first experimental study to show that a predator of any type actively chooses Anopheles as preferred prey, suggesting that specialized predators having a role in the biological control of disease vectors is a realistic possibility.\",TRUE\nA Role for Parasites in Stabilising the Fig-Pollinator Mutualism,\"Mutualisms are interspecific interactions in which both players benefit. Explaining their maintenance is problematic, because cheaters should outcompete cooperative conspecifics, leading to mutualism instability. Monoecious figs (Ficus) are pollinated by host-specific wasps (Agaonidae), whose larvae gall ovules in their \u201a\u00c4\u00fafruits\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 (syconia). Female pollinating wasps oviposit directly into Ficus ovules from inside the receptive syconium. Across Ficus species, there is a widely documented segregation of pollinator galls in inner ovules and seeds in outer ovules. This pattern suggests that wasps avoid, or are prevented from ovipositing into, outer ovules, and this results in mutualism stability. However, the mechanisms preventing wasps from exploiting outer ovules remain unknown. We report that in Ficus rubiginosa, offspring in outer ovules are vulnerable to attack by parasitic wasps that oviposit from outside the syconium. Parasitism risk decreases towards the centre of the syconium, where inner ovules provide enemy-free space for pollinator offspring. We suggest that the resulting gradient in offspring viability is likely to contribute to selection on pollinators to avoid outer ovules, and by\n######################\noutput:"}}

Roots and bark of Acokanthera schimperi (Apocynaceae) trees are gnawed, masticated and slavered onto highly specialized hairs that wick up the compound, to be delivered whenever the animal is bitten or mouthed by a predator. The poison is a cardenolide, closely resembling ouabain, one of the active components in a traditional African arrow poison long celebrated for its power to kill elephants.\",TRUE\nA Predator from East Africa that Chooses Malaria Vectors as Preferred Prey,\"Background All vectors of human malaria, a disease responsible for more than one million deaths per year, are female mosquitoes from the genus Anopheles.

Therefore, we quantified molecular forces across the essential integrin-binding protein Talin, which links integrin to the actin cytoskeleton. Generating flies expressing 3 F\u221a\u2202rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based Talin tension sensors reporting different force levels between 1 and 11 piconewton (pN) enabled us to quantify physiologically relevant molecular forces. By measuring primary Drosophila muscle cells, we demonstrate that Drosophila Talin experiences mechanical forces in cell culture that are similar to those previously reported for Talin in mammalian cell lines. However, in vivo force measurements at developing flight muscle attachment sites revealed that average forces across Talin are comparatively low and decrease even further while attachments mature and tissue-level tension remains high. Concomitantly, the Talin concentration at attachment sites increases 5-fold as quantified by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), suggesting that only a small proportion of Talin molecules are mechanically engaged at any given time. Reducing Talin levels at late stages of muscle development results in muscle\u201a\u00c4\u00ectendon rupture in the adult fly, likely as a result of active muscle contractions. We therefore propose that a large pool of adhesion molecules is required to share high tissue forces. As a result, less than 15% of the molecules experience detectable forces at developing muscle attachment sites at the same time. Our findings define an important new concept of how cells can adapt to changes in tissue mechanics to prevent mechanical failure in vivo.\",TRUE\n\"A specialized avian seed dispersal system in a dry-fruited non-photosynthetic plant, Balanophora yakushimensis.\",\"The family Balanophoraceae are among the most unusual of plants because they have aberrant vegetative bodies, highly reduced flowers, and small and reduced embryos (Hansen 1972, Gonzalez et al. 2019).

We suggest that the resulting gradient in offspring viability is likely to contribute to selection on pollinators to avoid outer ovules, and by forcing wasps to focus on a subset of ovules, reduces their galling rates. This previously unidentified mechanism may therefore contribute to mutualism persistence independent of additional factors that invoke plant defences against pollinator oviposition, or physiological constraints on pollinators that prevent oviposition in all available ovules.\",TRUE\nA seismic monitoring approach to detect and quantify river sediment mobilization by steelhead redd\u201a\u00c4\u00eabuilding activity,\"The role of spawning salmonids in altering river bed morphology and sediment transport is significant, yet poorly understood.

Based on work over nearly 200 years, it has become generally accepted that two touches of the trap\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s sensory hairs within 30 s, each one generating an action potential, are required to trigger closure of the trap. We developed an electromechanical model, which, however, suggests that under certain circumstances one touch is sufficient to generate two action potentials. Using a force-sensing microrobotic system, we precisely quantified the sensory-hair deflection parameters necessary to trigger trap closure and correlated them with the elicited action potentials in vivo. Our results confirm the model\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s predictions, suggesting that the Venus flytrap may be adapted to a wider range of prey movements than previously assumed.\",TRUE\nA small proportion of Talin molecules transmit forces at developing muscle attachments in vivo,\"Cells in developing organisms are subjected to particular mechanical forces that shape tissues and instruct cell fate decisions. How these forces are sensed and transmitted at the molecular level is therefore an important question, one that has mainly been investigated in cultured cells in vitro. Here, we elucidate how mechanical forces are transmitted in an intact organism. We studied Drosophila muscle attachment sites, which experience high mechanical forces during development and require integrin-mediated adhesion for stable attachment to tendons. Therefore, we quantified molecular forces across the essential integrin-binding protein Talin, which links integrin to the actin cytoskeleton.

This makes the lipid layers more ordered and creates a tighter barrier against water vapor diffusion, reducing water loss.\n\n2. **Mountain Pine Beetle Flight and Host Colonization**\n   - Female mountain pine beetles that fly longer distances and lose more body mass during flight are less likely to colonize new hosts (trees) but produce more aggregation pheromone.\n   - Male beetles' production of attraction pheromone is affected by their condition after flying, not the energy used during flight.\n   - This variation in flight behavior helps maintain population levels by balancing safe and risky host colonization strategies.\n\n3. **Piezoelectric Scaffold for Adaptive Bone Tissue Engineering**\n   - A new material system is developed that can adapt its mechanical properties in response to external stress.\n   - Piezoelectric scaffolds generate charges when stressed, which induce mineralization from surrounding media, reinforcing regions of high stress or damaged areas.\n   - This self-regenerating material could help address challenges in load-bearing applications by adapting to changing stress conditions.\n\n4. **Daily Variation of UV-Protective Compounds in Marine Dinoflagellate**\n   - The marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae increases its production of UV-absorbing compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids) when exposed to high photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) or PAR plus ultraviolet radiation (UVR).\n   - These compounds help protect the dinoflagellate from UV damage.\n\n5. **Termite Mounds as Passive Ventilation Systems**\n   - Termite mounds in different environments use periodic solar heating to drive internal ventilation, functioning like an external lung for the colony.\n   - Despite differences in gas stratification and overturning patterns, termite architectures can harness solar energy to facilitate gas exchange, with implications for human engineering. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

Experiments show that this spider can identify its preferred prey by sight alone and by odor alone. When presented with two types of size-matched motionless lures, E. culicivora consistently chose blood-fed female mosquitoes in preference to nonmosquito prey, male mosquitoes, and sugar-fed female mosquitoes (i.e., females that had not been feeding on blood). When the choice was between mosquitoes of different sizes (both blood- or both sugar-fed), small juveniles chose the smaller prey, whereas adults and larger juveniles chose the larger prey. However, preference for blood took precedence over preference for size (i.e., to get a blood meal, small individuals took prey that were larger than the preferred size, and larger individuals took prey that were smaller than the preferred size). When presented with odor from two prey types, E. culicivora approached the odor from blood-fed female mosquitoes significantly more often the odor of the prey that were not carrying blood.\",TRUE\n\"A sticky situation: solifugids (Arachnida, Solifugae) use adhesive organs on their pedipalps for prey capture\",\"Solifugids (Arachnida, Solifugae) have unique evertable adhesive organs on the tips of their pedipalps, named \u201a\u00c4\u00f2suctorial\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 or \u201a\u00c4\u00f2palpal\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 organs.

This makes the lipid layers more ordered and creates a tighter barrier against water vapor diffusion, reducing water loss.\n\n2. **Mountain Pine Beetle Flight and Host Colonization**\n   - Female mountain pine beetles that fly longer distances and lose more body mass during flight are less likely to colonize new hosts (trees) but produce more aggregation pheromone.\n   - Male beetles' production of attraction pheromone is affected by their condition after flying, not the energy used during flight.\n   - This variation in flight behavior helps maintain population levels by balancing safe and risky host colonization strategies.\n\n3. **Piezoelectric Scaffold for Adaptive Bone Tissue Engineering**\n   - A new material system is developed that can adapt its mechanical properties in response to external stress.\n   - Piezoelectric scaffolds generate charges when stressed, which induce mineralization from surrounding media, reinforcing regions of high stress or damaged areas.\n   - This self-regenerating material could help address challenges in load-bearing applications by adapting to changing stress conditions.\n\n4. **Daily Variation of UV-Protective Compounds in Marine Dinoflagellate**\n   - The marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae increases its production of UV-absorbing compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids) when exposed to high photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) or PAR plus ultraviolet radiation (UVR).\n   - These compounds help protect the dinoflagellate from UV damage.\n\n5. **Termite Mounds as Passive Ventilation Systems**\n   - Termite mounds in different environments use periodic solar heating to drive internal ventilation, functioning like an external lung for the colony.\n   - Despite differences in gas stratification and overturning patterns, termite architectures can harness solar energy to facilitate gas exchange, with implications for human engineering. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

The concentration of these UV-absorbing compounds was at a maximum in the first 2 min of secretion and decreased thereafter. Concentration was significantly related to the weight of the coral. Also, as corals were adapted to bathymetric levels of UV radiation, mucus concentration of UV-absorbing compounds decreased significantly with increasing depth.\",TRUE\nA symbiotic bacterium of shipworms produces a compound with broad spectrum anti-apicomplexan activity,\"Apicomplexan parasites cause severe disease in both humans and their domesticated animals. Since these parasites readily develop drug resistance, development of new, effective drugs to treat infection caused by these parasites is an ongoing challenge for the medical and veterinary communities. We hypothesized that invertebrate-bacterial symbioses might be a rich source of anti-apicomplexan compounds because invertebrates are susceptible to infections with gregarines, parasites that are ancestral to all apicomplexans. We chose to explore the therapeutic potential of shipworm symbiotic bacteria as they are bona fide symbionts, are easily grown in axenic culture and have genomes rich in secondary metabolite loci [1,2]. Two strains of the shipworm symbiotic bacterium, Teredinibacter turnerae, were screened for activity against Toxoplasma gondii and one strain, T7901, exhibited activity against intracellular stages of the parasite. Bioassay-guided fractionation identified tartrolon E (trtE) as the source of the activity. TrtE has an EC50 of 3 nM against T. gondii, acts directly on the parasite itself and kills the parasites after two hours of treatment. TrtE exhibits nanomolar to picomolar level activity against Cryptosporidium, Plasmodium,\n######################\noutput:"}}

Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain why the parents ingest, rather than simply remove the sacs. (1) The parental nutrition hypothesis proposes that the parent benefits energetically or nutritionally from ingesting the sacs (Morton 1979, Gluck 1988); and (2) the economic disposal hypothesis postulates that parents incur some costs from eating waste products, but the cost of eating them is less than the benefits gained from being allowed to remain at the nest (Hurd et al. 1991). Behavioral data on nesting Florida Scrub Jays (Aphelocoma c. coerulescens) and American Crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) support the parental nutrition, and not the economic disposal hypothesis. In both species, when two parents were present at the production of fecal sacs, the most nutritionally stressed parent, the female, ate significantly more sacs than her mate. On occasions where one adult left the nest immediately after fecal sac production and one remained, the departing adult was not more likely to dispose of the sac in either species. In neither species was a departing adult more likely to carry of a fecal sac than eat it\",TRUE\n\"A Unique Resource Mutualism between the Giant Bornean Pitcher Plant, Nepenthes rajah, and Members of a Small Mammal Community\",\"The carnivorous pitcher plant genus Nepenthes grows in nutrient-deficient substrates and produce jug-shaped leaf organs (pitchers) that trap arthropods as a source of N\n######################\noutput:"}}

A number of Bornean Nepenthes demonstrate novel nutrient acquisition strategies. Notably, three giant montane species are engaged in a mutualistic association with the mountain treeshrew, Tupaia montana, in which the treeshrew defecates into the pitchers while visiting them to feed on nectar secretions on the pitchers' lids. Although the basis of this resource mutualism has been elucidated, many aspects are yet to be investigated. We sought to provide insights into the value of the mutualism to each participant. During initial observations we discovered that the summit rat, R. baluensis, also feeds on sugary exudates of N. rajah pitchers and defecates into them, and that this behavior appears to be habitual. The scope of the study was therefore expanded to assess to what degree N. rajah interacts with the small mammal community. We found that both T. montana and R. baluensis are engaged in a mutualistic interaction with N. rajah. T .montana visit pitchers more frequently than R. baluensis, but daily scat deposition rates within pitchers do not differ, suggesting that the mutualistic relationships are of a similar strength. This study is the first to demonstrate that a mutualism exists between a carnivorous plant species and multiple members of a small mammal community. Further, the newly discovered mutualism between R. baluensis and N. rajah represents only the second ever example of a multidirectional resource-based mutualism between a mammal and a carnivorous plant.\",TRUE\nA Visual Pathway Links Brain Structures Active during Magnetic Compass Orientation in Migratory Birds,\"The magnetic compass of migratory birds has been suggested to be light-dependent.

In the course of a survey of ommatidial heterogeneity in butterflies, we found that members of the pierid genus Anthocharis lack the eye shine. We therefore carried out anatomy of the eye of the yellow tip, Anthocharis scolymus, and correlated it with the absence of the tapetum. The butterfly tapetum is a remnant of the ancestral moth tapetum, a trait that has been completely lost in the papilionids and also, as now appears, in the genus Anthocharis. Anatomical investigations also revealed that, considering rhabdom shape, peri-rhabdomal pigment clusters and autofluorescence, the ommatidia can be divided in at least two different types, which are randomly distributed in the retina.\",TRUE\nAccumulation of ammonia in the body and NH3 volatilization from alkaline regions of the body surface during ammonia loading and exposure to air in the weather loach Misgurnus anguillicaudatus,\"The weather loach Misgurnus anguillicaudatus inhabits rice fields that experience drought in summer and ammonia loading during agricultural fertilisation. Exposure of specimens to ammonia led to the accumulation of ammonia in muscle, liver and blood. The level of ammonia reached in the plasma was the highest reported among fishes. Ammonia was not detoxified to urea, and urea excretion rate was unaffected by ammonia exposure. Fish acidified the water to reduce ammonia loading. Ammonia loading, unlike aerial exposure, did not induce glutamine synthesis, and there was no accumulation of glutamine. This is a unique observation different from those reported for other fishes in the literature. An initial switch to partial amino acid catabolism led to the accumulation of alanine and was probably associated with a decreased rate of ammonia production. Aerial exposure led to decreases in rates of ammonia and urea excretion, as well as the accumulation of tissue ammonia. As the internal ammonia levels increased, M. anguillicaudatus was able to excrete some ammonia in the gaseous form (NH3). The percentage of ammonia excreted as NH3 increased with time of exposure and with increasing temperature. It appears that air-breathing through the gut is involved, with the anterior portion of the digestive tract playing a central role: it became significantly more alkaline in fish exposed to air or to environmental ammonia.

To date, the perceived ecological role for toxins has been relief from grazing pressures. Here, we demonstrate that karlotoxins also serve as a predation instrument. Using high-speed holographic microscopy, we measure the swimming behavior of several toxic and nontoxic strains of K. veneficum and their prey, Storeatula major, within dense suspensions. The selected strains produce toxins with varying potency and dosages, including a nontoxic one. Results clearly show that mixing the prey with the predatory, toxic strains causes prey immobilization at rates that are consistent with the karlotoxins\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 potency and dosage. Even prey cells that continue swimming slow down after exposure to toxic predators. The swimming characteristics of predators vary substantially in pure suspensions, as quantified by their velocity, radii of helical trajectories, and direction of helical rotation. When mixed with prey, all toxic strains that are involved in predation slow down. Furthermore, they substantially reduced their predominantly vertical migration, presumably to remain in the vicinity of their prey. Conversely, the nontoxic control strain does not alter its swimming and does not affect prey behavior. In separate experiments, we show that exposing prey to exogenous toxins also causes prey immobilization at rates consistent with potency. Clearly, the toxic predatory strains use karlotoxins as a means of stunning their prey, before ingesting it. These findings add a substantiated critical understanding for why some HAB species produce such complex toxin molecules.\",TRUE\nA dynamic broadband reflector built from microscopic silica spheres in the \u201a\u00c4\u00f2disco\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 clam Ctenoides ales,\"The \u201a\u00c4\u00f2disco\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 or \u201a\u00c4\u00f2electric\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 clam Ctenoides ales (Limidae) is the only species of bivalve known to have a behaviourally mediated photic display.

The tube-building corophioid amphipod Crassicorophium bonellii produces from its legs fibrous, adhesive underwater threads that combine barnacle cement biology with aspects of spider silk thread extrusion spinning. We characterised the filamentous silk as a mixture of mucopolysaccharides and protein deriving from glands representing two distinct types. The carbohydrate and protein silk secretion is dominated by complex \u0152\u2264-sheet structures and a high content of charged amino acid residues. The filamentous secretion product exits the gland through a pore near the tip of the secretory leg after having moved through a duct, which subdivides into several small ductules all terminating in a spindle-shaped chamber. This chamber communicates with the exterior and may be considered the silk reservoir and processing/mixing space, in which the silk is mechanically and potentially chemically altered and becomes fibrous. We assert that further study of this probably independently evolved, marine arthropod silk processing and secretion system can provide not only important insights into the more complex arachnid and insect silks but also into crustacean adhesion cements.\",TRUE\nA novel stiffening factor inducing the stiffest state of holothurian catch connective tissue,\"SUMMARY The dermis of sea cucumbers is a catch connective tissue or mutable collagenous tissue that shows large changes in stiffness. Extensive studies on the dermis revealed that it can adopt three different states having different mechanical properties that can be reversibly converted. These are the stiff, standard and soft states. The standard state is readily produced when a dermal piece is immersed in the sea water containing Ca2+, whereas the soft state can be produced by removal of Ca2+. A stiffening protein, tensilin, has been isolated from some sea cucumbers (Cucumaria frondosa and Holothuria leucospilota). Although tensilin converts the state of the dermis from soft to standard, it cannot convert from standard to stiff. In this study, we isolated and partially purified a novel stiffening factor from the dermis of Holothuria leucospilota. The factor stiffened\n######################\noutput:"}}

Abfrontal cilia and mucocytes were found in all species studied, with types and densities differing within and between gill types. The three species of homorhabdic filibranchs presented different densities of abfrontal cilia and mucocytes, from very dense in M. edulis to sparse in A. zebra. The heterorhabdic gills had intermediate cilia and mucocyte densities, with highest concentrations of both abfrontal cilia and mucocytes on the principal filaments. The eulamellibranchs showed low ciliary densities together with high mucocyte densities, especially in S. solidissima, where the abfrontal mucocytes were glandular. These results indicate that: (1) the abfrontal surface is a vestigial mucociliary surface; (2) the abfrontal surface cannot participate in water pumping in most species, due to low ciliary densities; and (3) species with high densities of abfrontal mucocytes could utilize abfrontal mucus to reduce drag, especially in the highly fused gills, such as those of the eulamellibranchs. The differing distributions of abfrontal cilia and mucocytes may reflect different selective pressures acting on the gills within the various taxa.\",TRUE\nA honey bee odorant receptor for the queen substance 9-oxo-2-decenoic acid,\"By using a functional genomics approach, we have identified a honey bee [Apis mellifera (Am)] odorant receptor (Or) for the queen substance 9-oxo-2-decenoic acid (9-ODA). Honey bees live in large eusocial colonies in which a single queen is responsible for reproduction, several thousand sterile female worker bees complete a myriad of tasks to maintain the colony, and several hundred male drones exist only to mate. The \u201a\u00c4\u00faqueen substance\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 [also termed the queen retinue pheromone (QRP)] is an eight-component pheromone that maintains the queen's dominance in the colony. The main component, 9-ODA, acts as a releaser pheromone by attracting workers to the queen and as a primer pheromone by physiologically inhibiting worker ovary development; it also acts as a sex pheromone, attracting drones\n######################\noutput:"}}

It is shown that the iridescent scales present in the rainbow-hued spots are due to a 3D photonic crystal network of chitin in air with a single diamond (Fd-3m) symmetry. In many insects, different orientations of photonic crystal domains are used to create various hues. In this weevil, however, both the chitin volume fractions as well as the lattice parameters of the biologically self-assembled single diamond nanostructure are varied to achieve the remarkable tuning of the structural colors across the visible light spectrum on a scale-by-scale basis. Uncovering the precise mechanism of color tuning employed by this weevil has important implications for further structural and developmental research on biophotonic nanostructures and may provide fresh impetus for bioinspired and biomimetic multifunctional applications, as synthesis of photonic crystals at visible length scales is currently challenging.\",TRUE\nA method for characterizing and mimicking forest canopy gaps caused by different disturbances,\"Forest canopy gaps are measurable indicators of past small-scale disturbances. These disturbances can impact forest stand dynamics in ways that help maintain and enhance many ecosystem values. Impacts are commonly assessed using timber production metrics based on average stand values, but metrics based on smaller scales are needed to assess impacts on nontimber resources. In this study, we developed a multivariate method of quantitatively characterizing individual canopy gaps in Douglas-fir/grand fir stands in the Blue Mountains of eastern Oregon. We then established a reference or target range of variability by profiling gaps according to numbers of snags, downed logs, gap size and shape, and recolonizing vegetation. Cluster analysis, multidimensional scaling, and classification trees were used with these profiles to quantify similarity among individual gaps. Gaps fell into four groups, which could be interpreted as three ecologically functional groups on the basis of their role in stand development. Gaps caused by the same agents commonly fell within the same functional group: (1) flooding, logging, spruce budworm, and windfall cause stand level impacts that reset the stand development sequence; (2) bark beetles, tree fall, and root diseases cause within stand impacts that altered the rate of stand development; and (3) stem decay and dwarf mistletoe, and, under some circumstances, all disturbance agents, could kill trees yet have no impact on stand development except create space into which\n######################\noutput:"}}

The main component, 9-ODA, acts as a releaser pheromone by attracting workers to the queen and as a primer pheromone by physiologically inhibiting worker ovary development; it also acts as a sex pheromone, attracting drones during mating flights. However, the extent to which social and sexual chemical messages are shared remains unresolved. By using a custom chemosensory-specific microarray and qPCR, we identified four candidate sex pheromone Ors (AmOr10, -11, -18, and -170) from the honey bee genome based on their biased expression in drone antennae. We assayed the pheromone responsiveness of these receptors by using Xenopus oocytes and electrophysiology. AmOr11 responded specifically to 9-ODA (EC50 = 280 \u00ac\u00b1 31 nM) and not to any of the other seven QRP components, other social pheromones, or floral odors. We did not observe any responses of the other three Ors to any of the eight QRP pheromone components, suggesting 9-ODA is the only QRP component that also acts as a long-distance sex pheromone.\",TRUE\n\"A lightweight, biological structure with tailored stiffness: The feather vane.\",\"UNLABELLEDThe flying feathers of birds are keratinous appendages designed for maximum performance with a minimum weight penalty. Thus, their design contains ingenious combinations of components that optimize lift, stiffness, aerodynamics, and damage resistance. This design involves two main parts: a central shaft that prescribes stiffness and lateral vanes which allows for the capture of air. Within the feather vane, barbs branch from the shaft and barbules branch from barbs, forming a flat surface which ensures lift. Microhooks at the end of barbules hold barbs tightly together, providing the close-knit, unified structure of the feather vane and enabling a repair of the structure through the reattachment of un-hooked junctions. Both the shaft and barbs are lightweight biological structures constructed of keratin using the common motif of a solid shell and cellular interior. The cellular core increases the resistance to buckling with little added weight. Here we analyze the detailed structure of the feather barb and, for the first time, explain its flexural stiffness in terms of the mechanics of asymmetric foam-filled beams subjected to bending. The results are correlated and validated with finite element modeling\n######################\noutput:"}}

This display is so vivid that it has been repeatedly confused for bioluminescence, but it is actually the result of scattered light. The flashing occurs on the mantle lip, where electron microscopy revealed two distinct tissue sides: one highly scattering side that contains dense aggregations of spheres composed of silica, and one highly absorbing side that does not. High-speed video confirmed that the two sides act in concert to alternate between vivid broadband reflectance and strong absorption in the blue region of the spectrum. Optical modelling suggests that the diameter of the spheres is nearly optimal for scattering visible light, especially at shorter wavelengths which predominate in their environment. This simple mechanism produces a striking optical effect that may function as a signal.\",TRUE\nA finite element simulation scheme for biological muscular hydrostats.,\"An explicit finite element scheme is developed for biological muscular hydrostats such as squid tentacles, octopus arms and elephant trunks. The scheme is implemented by embedding muscle fibers in finite elements. In any given element, the fiber orientation can be assigned arbitrarily and multiple muscle directions can be simulated. The mechanical stress in each muscle fiber is the sum of active and passive parts. The active stress is taken to be a function of activation state, muscle fiber shortening velocity and fiber strain; while the passive stress depends only on the strain. This scheme is tested by simulating extension of a squid tentacle during prey capture; our numerical predictions are in close correspondence with existing experimental results. It is shown that the present finite element scheme can successfully simulate more complex behaviors such as torsion of a squid tentacle and the bending behavior of octopus arms or elephant trunks.\",TRUE\nA functional interpretation of cilia and mucocyte distributions on the abfrontal surface of bivalve gills,\"Abstract The lack of fundamental data on the abfrontal surface of bivalve gills has prompted a comparative study of cilia and mucocytes on this surface, using scanning electron microscopy and histology on eight species of bivalves, representing seven families and the four major gill types: Mytilus edulis, Modiolus modiolus, Arca zebra, Placopecten magellanicus, Crassostrea virginica, Spisula solidissima, Mercenaria mercenaria, and Mya arenaria. Abfrontal cilia and mucocytes were found in all species studied, with types and densities differing within and between gill types. The three species of homorhab\n######################\noutput:"}}

Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain why the parents ingest, rather than simply remove the sacs. (1) The parental nutrition hypothesis proposes that the parent benefits energetically or nutritionally from ingesting the sacs (Morton 1979, Gluck 1988); and (2) the economic disposal hypothesis postulates that parents incur some costs from eating waste products, but the cost of eating them is less than the benefits gained from being allowed to remain at the nest (Hurd et al. 1991). Behavioral data on nesting Florida Scrub Jays (Aphelocoma c. coerulescens) and American Crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) support the parental nutrition, and not the economic disposal hypothesis. In both species, when two parents were present at the production of fecal sacs, the most nutritionally stressed parent, the female, ate significantly more sacs than her mate. On occasions where one adult left the nest immediately after fecal sac production and one remained, the departing adult was not more likely to dispose of the sac in either species. In neither species was a departing adult more likely to carry of a fecal sac than eat it\",TRUE\n\"A Unique Resource Mutualism between the Giant Bornean Pitcher Plant, Nepenthes rajah, and Members of a Small Mammal Community\",\"The carnivorous pitcher plant genus Nepenthes grows in nutrient-deficient substrates and produce jug-shaped leaf organs (pitchers) that trap arthropods as a source of N\n######################\noutput:"}}

Computational and biological systems are often distributed so that processors (cells) jointly solve a task, without any of them receiving all inputs or observing all outputs. Maximal independent set (MIS) selection is a fundamental distributed computing procedure that seeks to elect a set of local leaders in a network. A variant of this problem is solved during the development of the fly\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s nervous system, when sensory organ precursor (SOP) cells are chosen. By studying SOP selection, we derived a fast algorithm for MIS selection that combines two attractive features. First, processors do not need to know their degree; second, it has an optimal message complexity while only using one-bit messages. Our findings suggest that simple and efficient algorithms can be developed on the basis of biologically derived insights.\",TRUE\nA biological sub-micron thickness optical broadband reflector characterized using both light and microwaves,\"Broadband optical reflectors generally function through coherent scattering from systems comprising one of three designs: overlapped; chirped; or chaotic multilayer reflectors. For each, the requirement to scatter a broad band of wavelengths is met through the presence of a variation in nanostructural periodicity running perpendicular to the systems' outer surfaces. Consequently, the requisite total thickness of the multilayer can often be in excess of 50\u201a\u00c4\u00e4\u0152\u00bam. Here, we report the discovery and the microwave-assisted characterization of a natural system that achieves excellent optical broadband reflectivity but that is less than 1\u201a\u00c4\u00e4\u0152\u00bam thick. This system, found on the wing scales of the butterfly Argyrophorus argenteus, comprises a distinctive variation in periodicity that runs parallel to the reflecting surface, rather than perpendicular to it. In this way, the requirement for an extensively thick system is removed.\",TRUE\nA branched material based on biomimetic design: Synthesis and electrochemical properties,\"Based on the biomimetic route the metal material with tree-like fractal structure was prepared, which showed a rough surface observed by scanning electron\n######################\noutput:"}}

We chose to explore the therapeutic potential of shipworm symbiotic bacteria as they are bona fide symbionts, are easily grown in axenic culture and have genomes rich in secondary metabolite loci [1,2]. Two strains of the shipworm symbiotic bacterium, Teredinibacter turnerae, were screened for activity against Toxoplasma gondii and one strain, T7901, exhibited activity against intracellular stages of the parasite. Bioassay-guided fractionation identified tartrolon E (trtE) as the source of the activity.

Experiments show that this spider can identify its preferred prey by sight alone and by odor alone. When presented with two types of size-matched motionless lures, E. culicivora consistently chose blood-fed female mosquitoes in preference to nonmosquito prey, male mosquitoes, and sugar-fed female mosquitoes (i.e., females that had not been feeding on blood). When the choice was between mosquitoes of different sizes (both blood- or both sugar-fed), small juveniles chose the smaller prey, whereas adults and larger juveniles chose the larger prey. However, preference for blood took precedence over preference for size (i.e., to get a blood meal, small individuals took prey that were larger than the preferred size, and larger individuals took prey that were smaller than the preferred size). When presented with odor from two prey types, E. culicivora approached the odor from blood-fed female mosquitoes significantly more often the odor of the prey that were not carrying blood.\",TRUE\n\"A sticky situation: solifugids (Arachnida, Solifugae) use adhesive organs on their pedipalps for prey capture\",\"Solifugids (Arachnida, Solifugae) have unique evertable adhesive organs on the tips of their pedipalps, named \u201a\u00c4\u00f2suctorial\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 or \u201a\u00c4\u00f2palpal\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 organs.

These mounds vary geographically in mean orientation in a manner that suggests such variation is an adaptive response to local environmental conditions. Theoretical modelling of solar irradiance and mound rotation experiments show that maintenance of an eastern face temperature plateau during the dry season is the most likely physical basis for the mound orientation response. Subsequent heat transfer analysis shows that habitat wind speed and shading conditions also affect face temperature gradients such as the rate of eastern face temperature change. It is then demonstrated that the geographic variation in mean mound orientation follows the geographic variation in long-term wind speed and shading conditions across northern Australia such that an eastern face temperature plateau is maintained in all locations.,TRUE\n2.

In this study, a model of the LGMD neuron is presented and the functional parameters of the model identified. Models with different parameters were presented with a range of automotive video sequences, including collisions with cars. The parameters were optimised to respond correctly to the video sequences using a range of genetic algorithms (GAs).

A number of Bornean Nepenthes demonstrate novel nutrient acquisition strategies. Notably, three giant montane species are engaged in a mutualistic association with the mountain treeshrew, Tupaia montana, in which the treeshrew defecates into the pitchers while visiting them to feed on nectar secretions on the pitchers' lids. Although the basis of this resource mutualism has been elucidated, many aspects are yet to be investigated. We sought to provide insights into the value of the mutualism to each participant. During initial observations we discovered that the summit rat, R. baluensis, also feeds on sugary exudates of N. rajah pitchers and defecates into them, and that this behavior appears to be habitual. The scope of the study was therefore expanded to assess to what degree N. rajah interacts with the small mammal community. We found that both T. montana and R. baluensis are engaged in a mutualistic interaction with N. rajah. T .montana visit pitchers more frequently than R. baluensis, but daily scat deposition rates within pitchers do not differ, suggesting that the mutualistic relationships are of a similar strength. This study is the first to demonstrate that a mutualism exists between a carnivorous plant species and multiple members of a small mammal community. Further, the newly discovered mutualism between R. baluensis and N. rajah represents only the second ever example of a multidirectional resource-based mutualism between a mammal and a carnivorous plant.\",TRUE\nA Visual Pathway Links Brain Structures Active during Magnetic Compass Orientation in Migratory Birds,\"The magnetic compass of migratory birds has been suggested to be light-dependent.

Although all previously described TH-producing biomolecules are proteins, most thermal hysteresis factors (THFs) have not yet been structurally characterized, and none have been characterized from a freeze-tolerant animal. We isolated a highly active THF from the freeze-tolerant beetle, Upis ceramboides, by means of ice affinity. Amino acid chromatographic analysis, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, UV-Vis spectrophotometry, and NMR spectroscopy indicated that the THF contained little or no protein, yet it produced 3.7 \u00ac\u00b1 0.3 \u00ac\u221eC of TH at 5 mg/ml, comparable to that of the most active insect antifreeze proteins.

The cellular core increases the resistance to buckling with little added weight. Here we analyze the detailed structure of the feather barb and, for the first time, explain its flexural stiffness in terms of the mechanics of asymmetric foam-filled beams subjected to bending. The results are correlated and validated with finite element modeling. We compare the flexure of single barbs as well as arrays of barbs and find that the interlocking adherence of barbs to one another enables a more robust structure due to minimized barb rotation during deflection. Thus, the flexure behavior of the feather vane can be tailored by the adhesive hooking between barbs, creating a system that mitigates damage. A simplified three-dimensional physical model for this interlocking mechanism is constructed by additive manufacturing. The exceptional architecture of the feather vane will motivate the design of bioinspired structures with tailored and unique properties ranging from adhesives to aerospace materials.STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEDespite its importance to bird flight, literature characterizing the feather vane is extremely limited. The feather vane is composed of barbs that branch from the main shaft (rachis) and barbules that branch from barbs. In this study, the flexural behavior of the feather barb and the role of barbule connections in reinforcing the feather vane are quantitatively investigated for the first time, both experimentally and theoretically. Through the performed experiments, structure-function relationships within the feather vane are uncovered. Additionally, in the proposed model the sophisticated structure of the barbs and the interlocking mechanism of the feather vane are simplified to understand these processes in order to engineer new lightweight structures and adhesives.\",TRUE\nA Literal Elytral Rainbow: Tunable Structural Colors Using Single Diamond Biophotonic Crystals in Pachyrrhynchus congestus Weevils.,\"The brilliant colors of many insects arise from the interference of incident light with complex nanostructured biomaterials that are present in their cuticle.

Anatomical investigations also revealed that, considering rhabdom shape, peri-rhabdomal pigment clusters and autofluorescence, the ommatidia can be divided in at least two different types, which are randomly distributed in the retina.\",TRUE\nAccumulation of ammonia in the body and NH3 volatilization from alkaline regions of the body surface during ammonia loading and exposure to air in the weather loach Misgurnus anguillicaudatus,\"The weather loach Misgurnus anguillicaudatus inhabits rice fields that experience drought in summer and ammonia loading during agricultural fertilisation. Exposure of specimens to ammonia led to the accumulation of ammonia in muscle, liver and blood. The level of ammonia reached in the plasma was the highest reported among fishes. Ammonia was not detoxified to urea, and urea excretion rate was unaffected by ammonia exposure. Fish acidified the water to reduce ammonia loading. Ammonia loading, unlike aerial exposure, did not induce glutamine synthesis, and there was no accumulation of glutamine. This is a unique observation different from those reported for other fishes in the literature. An initial switch to partial amino acid catabolism led to the accumulation of alanine and was probably associated with a decreased rate of ammonia production. Aerial exposure led to decreases in rates of ammonia and urea excretion, as well as the accumulation of tissue ammonia. As the internal ammonia levels increased, M. anguillicaudatus was able to excrete some ammonia in the gaseous form (NH3). The percentage of ammonia excreted as NH3 increased with time of exposure and with increasing temperature. It appears that air-breathing through the gut is involved, with the anterior portion of the digestive tract playing a central role: it became significantly more alkaline in fish exposed to air or to environmental ammonia.

Since the color of eye shine is determined by the spectral properties of the ommatidia, it has been tentatively related to color vision.

Silk proteins are reminiscent of amphiphilic block copolymers containing stretches of polyalanine and glycine-rich polar elements forming a repetitive core flanked by highly conserved non-repetitive amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal domains. The N-terminal domain comprises a secretion signal, but further functions remain unassigned. The C-terminal domain was implicated in the control of solubility and fibre formation initiated by changes in ionic composition and mechanical stimuli known to align the repetitive sequence elements and promote \u0152\u2264-sheet formation. However, despite recent structural data, little is known about this remarkable behaviour in molecular detail. Here we present the solution structure of the C-terminal domain of a spider dragline silk protein and provide evidence that the structural state of this domain is essential for controlled switching between the storage and assembly forms of silk proteins. In addition, the C-terminal domain also has a role in the alignment of secondary structural features formed by the repetitive elements in the backbone of spider silk proteins, which is known to be important for the mechanical properties of the fibre.\",TRUE\nA Cultured Greigite-Producing Magnetotactic Bacterium in a Novel Group of Sulfate-Reducing Bacteria,\"The crystal structure of biomineralized magnetic nanocrystals depends on environmental and genetic factors.

We isolated a greigite-producing magnetotactic bacterium from a brackish spring in Death Valley National Park, California, USA, strain BW-1, that is able to biomineralize greigite and magnetite depending on culture conditions. A phylogenetic comparison of BW-1 and similar uncultured greigite- and/or magnetite-producing magnetotactic bacteria from freshwater to hypersaline habitats shows that these organisms represent a previously unknown group of sulfate-reducing bacteria in the Deltaproteobacteria. Genomic analysis of BW-1 reveals the presence of two different magnetosome gene clusters, suggesting that one may be responsible for greigite biomineralization and the other for magnetite.\",TRUE\nA dinoflagellate exploits toxins to immobilize prey prior to ingestion,\"Toxins produced by the harmful algal bloom (HAB) forming, mixotrophic dinoflagellate\n######################\noutput:"}}

Evarcha culicivora is an East African jumping spider (Salticidae) that feeds indirectly on vertebrate blood by selecting blood-carrying female mosquitoes as preferred prey. Methodology/Principal Findings By testing with motionless lures made from mounting dead insects in lifelike posture on cork discs, we show that E. culicivora selects Anopheles mosquitoes in preference to other mosquitoes and that this predator can identify Anopheles by static appearance alone. Tests using active (grooming) virtual mosquitoes rendered in 3-D animation show that Anopheles' characteristic resting posture is an important prey-choice cue for E. culicivora. Expression of the spider's preference for Anopheles varies with the spider's size, varies with its prior feeding condition and is independent of the spider gaining a blood meal. Conclusions/Significance This is the first experimental study to show that a predator of any type actively chooses Anopheles as preferred prey, suggesting that specialized predators having a role in the biological control of disease vectors is a realistic possibility.\",TRUE\nA Role for Parasites in Stabilising the Fig-Pollinator Mutualism,\"Mutualisms are interspecific interactions in which both players benefit. Explaining their maintenance is problematic, because cheaters should outcompete cooperative conspecifics, leading to mutualism instability. Monoecious figs (Ficus) are pollinated by host-specific wasps (Agaonidae), whose larvae gall ovules in their \u201a\u00c4\u00fafruits\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 (syconia). Female pollinating wasps oviposit directly into Ficus ovules from inside the receptive syconium. Across Ficus species, there is a widely documented segregation of pollinator galls in inner ovules and seeds in outer ovules. This pattern suggests that wasps avoid, or are prevented from ovipositing into, outer ovules, and this results in mutualism stability. However, the mechanisms preventing wasps from exploiting outer ovules remain unknown. We report that in Ficus rubiginosa, offspring in outer ovules are vulnerable to attack by parasitic wasps that oviposit from outside the syconium. Parasitism risk decreases towards the centre of the syconium, where inner ovules provide enemy-free space for pollinator offspring. We suggest that the resulting gradient in offspring viability is likely to contribute to selection on pollinators to avoid outer ovules, and by\n######################\noutput:"}}

Although tensilin converts the state of the dermis from soft to standard, it cannot convert from standard to stiff. In this study, we isolated and partially purified a novel stiffening factor from the dermis of Holothuria leucospilota. The factor stiffened the dermis in normal artificial sea water (ASW) but did not stiffen the soft dermis in Ca2+-free ASW. It also stiffened the dermis that had been converted to the standard state in Ca2+-free ASW by the action of tensilin. These results suggest that the factor produces the stiff dermis from the standard state but cannot work as a stiffener on the soft dermis. Its addition to longitudinal muscles of the sea cucumber produced no effects, suggesting that its effect is specific to the catch connective tissue.

This article investigates the structural development and morphology of these adhesive pads and aims to understand the underlying structure-function relationship of the attachment process. Based on our results, we discuss possible mechanical consequences of the tendril structure and compare our findings with similar attachment systems in unrelated species in order to identify general strategies of this mode of attachment. Methodology.\u201a\u00c4\u00c9We investigated the temporal development of the attachment process, including detailed studies of the morphology and anatomy of the adhesive pads, using LM with different staining procedures and SEM. Pivotal results.\u201a\u00c4\u00c9Young tendrils establish initial contact with a supporting substrate by interlocking with their hook-shaped tips. Touch stimuli induce the tips to develop into adhesive pads by callus-like growth of papillate epidermal cells. Fully grown pads are hemispherical on flat substrates or completely fill out larger cavities of the substrate. By apical cell division, the pad tissue perfectly mimics the microtopography of the substrate and also grows into minute gaps and fissures, establishing firm anchorage by optimal form closure.

Therefore, we quantified molecular forces across the essential integrin-binding protein Talin, which links integrin to the actin cytoskeleton. Generating flies expressing 3 F\u221a\u2202rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based Talin tension sensors reporting different force levels between 1 and 11 piconewton (pN) enabled us to quantify physiologically relevant molecular forces. By measuring primary Drosophila muscle cells, we demonstrate that Drosophila Talin experiences mechanical forces in cell culture that are similar to those previously reported for Talin in mammalian cell lines. However, in vivo force measurements at developing flight muscle attachment sites revealed that average forces across Talin are comparatively low and decrease even further while attachments mature and tissue-level tension remains high. Concomitantly, the Talin concentration at attachment sites increases 5-fold as quantified by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), suggesting that only a small proportion of Talin molecules are mechanically engaged at any given time. Reducing Talin levels at late stages of muscle development results in muscle\u201a\u00c4\u00ectendon rupture in the adult fly, likely as a result of active muscle contractions. We therefore propose that a large pool of adhesion molecules is required to share high tissue forces. As a result, less than 15% of the molecules experience detectable forces at developing muscle attachment sites at the same time. Our findings define an important new concept of how cells can adapt to changes in tissue mechanics to prevent mechanical failure in vivo.\",TRUE\n\"A specialized avian seed dispersal system in a dry-fruited non-photosynthetic plant, Balanophora yakushimensis.\",\"The family Balanophoraceae are among the most unusual of plants because they have aberrant vegetative bodies, highly reduced flowers, and small and reduced embryos (Hansen 1972, Gonzalez et al. 2019).

However, recent data show that the amount of protein damage caused during irradiation of bacteria is better related to survival than to DNA damage. In this Opinion article, a new model is presented in which proteins are the most important target in the hierarchy of macromolecules affected by IR. A first line of defence against IR in extremely radiation-resistant bacteria might be the accumulation of manganese complexes, which can prevent the production of iron-dependent reactive oxygen species. This would allow an irradiated cell to protect sufficient enzymatic activity needed to repair DNA and survive.\",TRUE\n\"A nocturnal mammal, the greater mouse-eared bat, calibrates a magnetic compass by the sun\",\"Recent evidence suggests that bats can detect the geomagnetic field, but the way in which this is used by them for navigation to a home roost remains unresolved. The geomagnetic field may be used by animals both to indicate direction and to locate position. In birds, directional information appears to be derived from an interaction of the magnetic field with either the sun or the stars, with some evidence suggesting that sunset/sunrise provides the primary directional reference by which a magnetic compass is calibrated daily. We demonstrate that homing greater mouse-eared bats (Myotis myotis) calibrate a magnetic compass with sunset cues by testing their homing response after exposure to an altered magnetic field at and after sunset. Magnetic manipulation at sunset resulted in a counterclockwise shift in orientation compared with controls, consistent with sunset calibration of the magnetic field, whereas magnetic manipulation after sunset resulted in no change in orientation.

Return output in Here's a simplified summary of each text in plain language:\n\n1. **Bird Skin Lipids Adaptation to Desert Environments**\n   - Larks living in hot, dry deserts have less water loss from their skin compared to those in more humid environments.\n   - Instead of having more lipids in their skin (stratum corneum), desert larks have a higher proportion of certain ceramides and fewer free fatty acids. This makes the lipid layers more ordered and creates a tighter barrier against water vapor diffusion, reducing water loss.\n\n2. **Mountain Pine Beetle Flight and Host Colonization**\n   - Female mountain pine beetles that fly longer distances and lose more body mass during flight are less likely to colonize new hosts (trees) but produce more aggregation pheromone.\n   - Male beetles' production of attraction pheromone is affected by their condition after flying, not the energy used during flight.\n   - This variation in flight behavior helps maintain population levels by balancing safe and risky host colonization strategies.\n\n3. **Piezoelectric Scaffold for Adaptive Bone Tissue Engineering**\n   - A new material system is developed that can adapt its mechanical properties in response to external stress.\n   - Piezoelectric scaffolds generate charges when stressed, which induce mineralization from surrounding media, reinforcing regions of high stress or damaged areas.\n   - This self-regenerating material could help address challenges in load-bearing applications by adapting to changing stress conditions.\n\n4. **Daily Variation of UV-Protective Compounds in Marine Dinoflagellate**\n   - The marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae increases its production of UV-absorbing compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids) when exposed to high photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) or PAR plus ultraviolet radiation (UVR).\n   - These compounds help protect the dinoflagellate from UV damage.\n\n5. **Termite Mounds as Passive Ventilation Systems**\n   - Termite mounds in different environments use periodic solar heating to drive internal ventilation, functioning like an external lung for the colony.\n   - Despite differences in gas stratification and overturning patterns, termite architectures can harness solar energy to facilitate gas exchange, with implications for human engineering. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

Return output in Here's a simplified summary of each text in plain language:\n\n1. **Bird Skin Lipids Adaptation to Desert Environments**\n   - Larks living in hot, dry deserts have less water loss from their skin compared to those in more humid environments.\n   - Instead of having more lipids in their skin (stratum corneum), desert larks have a higher proportion of certain ceramides and fewer free fatty acids. This makes the lipid layers more ordered and creates a tighter barrier against water vapor diffusion, reducing water loss.\n\n2. **Mountain Pine Beetle Flight and Host Colonization**\n   - Female mountain pine beetles that fly longer distances and lose more body mass during flight are less likely to colonize new hosts (trees) but produce more aggregation pheromone.\n   - Male beetles' production of attraction pheromone is affected by their condition after flying, not the energy used during flight.\n   - This variation in flight behavior helps maintain population levels by balancing safe and risky host colonization strategies.\n\n3. **Piezoelectric Scaffold for Adaptive Bone Tissue Engineering**\n   - A new material system is developed that can adapt its mechanical properties in response to external stress.\n   - Piezoelectric scaffolds generate charges when stressed, which induce mineralization from surrounding media, reinforcing regions of high stress or damaged areas.\n   - This self-regenerating material could help address challenges in load-bearing applications by adapting to changing stress conditions.\n\n4. **Daily Variation of UV-Protective Compounds in Marine Dinoflagellate**\n   - The marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae increases its production of UV-absorbing compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids) when exposed to high photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) or PAR plus ultraviolet radiation (UVR).\n   - These compounds help protect the dinoflagellate from UV damage.\n\n5. **Termite Mounds as Passive Ventilation Systems**\n   - Termite mounds in different environments use periodic solar heating to drive internal ventilation, functioning like an external lung for the colony.\n   - Despite differences in gas stratification and overturning patterns, termite architectures can harness solar energy to facilitate gas exchange, with implications for human engineering. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

The tube-building corophioid amphipod Crassicorophium bonellii produces from its legs fibrous, adhesive underwater threads that combine barnacle cement biology with aspects of spider silk thread extrusion spinning. We characterised the filamentous silk as a mixture of mucopolysaccharides and protein deriving from glands representing two distinct types. The carbohydrate and protein silk secretion is dominated by complex \u0152\u2264-sheet structures and a high content of charged amino acid residues. The filamentous secretion product exits the gland through a pore near the tip of the secretory leg after having moved through a duct, which subdivides into several small ductules all terminating in a spindle-shaped chamber. This chamber communicates with the exterior and may be considered the silk reservoir and processing/mixing space, in which the silk is mechanically and potentially chemically altered and becomes fibrous. We assert that further study of this probably independently evolved, marine arthropod silk processing and secretion system can provide not only important insights into the more complex arachnid and insect silks but also into crustacean adhesion cements.\",TRUE\nA novel stiffening factor inducing the stiffest state of holothurian catch connective tissue,\"SUMMARY The dermis of sea cucumbers is a catch connective tissue or mutable collagenous tissue that shows large changes in stiffness. Extensive studies on the dermis revealed that it can adopt three different states having different mechanical properties that can be reversibly converted. These are the stiff, standard and soft states. The standard state is readily produced when a dermal piece is immersed in the sea water containing Ca2+, whereas the soft state can be produced by removal of Ca2+. A stiffening protein, tensilin, has been isolated from some sea cucumbers (Cucumaria frondosa and Holothuria leucospilota). Although tensilin converts the state of the dermis from soft to standard, it cannot convert from standard to stiff. In this study, we isolated and partially purified a novel stiffening factor from the dermis of Holothuria leucospilota. The factor stiffened\n######################\noutput:"}}

Return output in Here's a simplified summary of each text in plain language:\n\n1. **Bird Skin Lipids Adaptation to Desert Environments**\n   - Larks living in hot, dry deserts have less water loss from their skin compared to those in more humid environments.\n   - Instead of having more lipids in their skin (stratum corneum), desert larks have a higher proportion of certain ceramides and fewer free fatty acids. This makes the lipid layers more ordered and creates a tighter barrier against water vapor diffusion, reducing water loss.\n\n2. **Mountain Pine Beetle Flight and Host Colonization**\n   - Female mountain pine beetles that fly longer distances and lose more body mass during flight are less likely to colonize new hosts (trees) but produce more aggregation pheromone.\n   - Male beetles' production of attraction pheromone is affected by their condition after flying, not the energy used during flight.\n   - This variation in flight behavior helps maintain population levels by balancing safe and risky host colonization strategies.\n\n3. **Piezoelectric Scaffold for Adaptive Bone Tissue Engineering**\n   - A new material system is developed that can adapt its mechanical properties in response to external stress.\n   - Piezoelectric scaffolds generate charges when stressed, which induce mineralization from surrounding media, reinforcing regions of high stress or damaged areas.\n   - This self-regenerating material could help address challenges in load-bearing applications by adapting to changing stress conditions.\n\n4. **Daily Variation of UV-Protective Compounds in Marine Dinoflagellate**\n   - The marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae increases its production of UV-absorbing compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids) when exposed to high photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) or PAR plus ultraviolet radiation (UVR).\n   - These compounds help protect the dinoflagellate from UV damage.\n\n5. **Termite Mounds as Passive Ventilation Systems**\n   - Termite mounds in different environments use periodic solar heating to drive internal ventilation, functioning like an external lung for the colony.\n   - Despite differences in gas stratification and overturning patterns, termite architectures can harness solar energy to facilitate gas exchange, with implications for human engineering. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

It is shown that the iridescent scales present in the rainbow-hued spots are due to a 3D photonic crystal network of chitin in air with a single diamond (Fd-3m) symmetry. In many insects, different orientations of photonic crystal domains are used to create various hues. In this weevil, however, both the chitin volume fractions as well as the lattice parameters of the biologically self-assembled single diamond nanostructure are varied to achieve the remarkable tuning of the structural colors across the visible light spectrum on a scale-by-scale basis.

These disturbances can impact forest stand dynamics in ways that help maintain and enhance many ecosystem values.

In this study, we developed a multivariate method of quantitatively characterizing individual canopy gaps in Douglas-fir/grand fir stands in the Blue Mountains of eastern Oregon. We then established a reference or target range of variability by profiling gaps according to numbers of snags, downed logs, gap size and shape, and recolonizing vegetation. Cluster analysis, multidimensional scaling, and classification trees were used with these profiles to quantify similarity among individual gaps. Gaps fell into four groups, which could be interpreted as three ecologically functional groups on the basis of their role in stand development. Gaps caused by the same agents commonly fell within the same functional group: (1) flooding, logging, spruce budworm, and windfall cause stand level impacts that reset the stand development sequence; (2) bark beetles, tree fall, and root diseases cause within stand impacts that altered the rate of stand development; and (3) stem decay and dwarf mistletoe, and, under some circumstances, all disturbance agents, could kill trees yet have no impact on stand development except create space into which\n######################\noutput:"}}

Return output in Here's a simplified summary of each text in plain language:\n\n1. **Bird Skin Lipids Adaptation to Desert Environments**\n   - Larks living in hot, dry deserts have less water loss from their skin compared to those in more humid environments.\n   - Instead of having more lipids in their skin (stratum corneum), desert larks have a higher proportion of certain ceramides and fewer free fatty acids. This makes the lipid layers more ordered and creates a tighter barrier against water vapor diffusion, reducing water loss.\n\n2. **Mountain Pine Beetle Flight and Host Colonization**\n   - Female mountain pine beetles that fly longer distances and lose more body mass during flight are less likely to colonize new hosts (trees) but produce more aggregation pheromone.\n   - Male beetles' production of attraction pheromone is affected by their condition after flying, not the energy used during flight.\n   - This variation in flight behavior helps maintain population levels by balancing safe and risky host colonization strategies.\n\n3. **Piezoelectric Scaffold for Adaptive Bone Tissue Engineering**\n   - A new material system is developed that can adapt its mechanical properties in response to external stress.\n   - Piezoelectric scaffolds generate charges when stressed, which induce mineralization from surrounding media, reinforcing regions of high stress or damaged areas.\n   - This self-regenerating material could help address challenges in load-bearing applications by adapting to changing stress conditions.\n\n4. **Daily Variation of UV-Protective Compounds in Marine Dinoflagellate**\n   - The marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae increases its production of UV-absorbing compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids) when exposed to high photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) or PAR plus ultraviolet radiation (UVR).\n   - These compounds help protect the dinoflagellate from UV damage.\n\n5. **Termite Mounds as Passive Ventilation Systems**\n   - Termite mounds in different environments use periodic solar heating to drive internal ventilation, functioning like an external lung for the colony.\n   - Despite differences in gas stratification and overturning patterns, termite architectures can harness solar energy to facilitate gas exchange, with implications for human engineering. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

The main component, 9-ODA, acts as a releaser pheromone by attracting workers to the queen and as a primer pheromone by physiologically inhibiting worker ovary development; it also acts as a sex pheromone, attracting drones during mating flights. However, the extent to which social and sexual chemical messages are shared remains unresolved. By using a custom chemosensory-specific microarray and qPCR, we identified four candidate sex pheromone Ors (AmOr10, -11, -18, and -170) from the honey bee genome based on their biased expression in drone antennae. We assayed the pheromone responsiveness of these receptors by using Xenopus oocytes and electrophysiology. AmOr11 responded specifically to 9-ODA (EC50 = 280 \u00ac\u00b1 31 nM) and not to any of the other seven QRP components, other social pheromones, or floral odors. We did not observe any responses of the other three Ors to any of the eight QRP pheromone components, suggesting 9-ODA is the only QRP component that also acts as a long-distance sex pheromone.\",TRUE\n\"A lightweight, biological structure with tailored stiffness: The feather vane.\",\"UNLABELLEDThe flying feathers of birds are keratinous appendages designed for maximum performance with a minimum weight penalty. Thus, their design contains ingenious combinations of components that optimize lift, stiffness, aerodynamics, and damage resistance. This design involves two main parts: a central shaft that prescribes stiffness and lateral vanes which allows for the capture of air. Within the feather vane, barbs branch from the shaft and barbules branch from barbs, forming a flat surface which ensures lift. Microhooks at the end of barbules hold barbs tightly together, providing the close-knit, unified structure of the feather vane and enabling a repair of the structure through the reattachment of un-hooked junctions. Both the shaft and barbs are lightweight biological structures constructed of keratin using the common motif of a solid shell and cellular interior. The cellular core increases the resistance to buckling with little added weight. Here we analyze the detailed structure of the feather barb and, for the first time, explain its flexural stiffness in terms of the mechanics of asymmetric foam-filled beams subjected to bending. The results are correlated and validated with finite element modeling\n######################\noutput:"}}

Return output in Here's a simplified summary of each text in plain language:\n\n1. **Bird Skin Lipids Adaptation to Desert Environments**\n   - Larks living in hot, dry deserts have less water loss from their skin compared to those in more humid environments.\n   - Instead of having more lipids in their skin (stratum corneum), desert larks have a higher proportion of certain ceramides and fewer free fatty acids. This makes the lipid layers more ordered and creates a tighter barrier against water vapor diffusion, reducing water loss.\n\n2. **Mountain Pine Beetle Flight and Host Colonization**\n   - Female mountain pine beetles that fly longer distances and lose more body mass during flight are less likely to colonize new hosts (trees) but produce more aggregation pheromone.\n   - Male beetles' production of attraction pheromone is affected by their condition after flying, not the energy used during flight.\n   - This variation in flight behavior helps maintain population levels by balancing safe and risky host colonization strategies.\n\n3. **Piezoelectric Scaffold for Adaptive Bone Tissue Engineering**\n   - A new material system is developed that can adapt its mechanical properties in response to external stress.\n   - Piezoelectric scaffolds generate charges when stressed, which induce mineralization from surrounding media, reinforcing regions of high stress or damaged areas.\n   - This self-regenerating material could help address challenges in load-bearing applications by adapting to changing stress conditions.\n\n4. **Daily Variation of UV-Protective Compounds in Marine Dinoflagellate**\n   - The marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae increases its production of UV-absorbing compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids) when exposed to high photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) or PAR plus ultraviolet radiation (UVR).\n   - These compounds help protect the dinoflagellate from UV damage.\n\n5. **Termite Mounds as Passive Ventilation Systems**\n   - Termite mounds in different environments use periodic solar heating to drive internal ventilation, functioning like an external lung for the colony.\n   - Despite differences in gas stratification and overturning patterns, termite architectures can harness solar energy to facilitate gas exchange, with implications for human engineering. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

In the course of a survey of ommatidial heterogeneity in butterflies, we found that members of the pierid genus Anthocharis lack the eye shine. We therefore carried out anatomy of the eye of the yellow tip, Anthocharis scolymus, and correlated it with the absence of the tapetum. The butterfly tapetum is a remnant of the ancestral moth tapetum, a trait that has been completely lost in the papilionids and also, as now appears, in the genus Anthocharis.

Ammonia was not detoxified to urea, and urea excretion rate was unaffected by ammonia exposure. Fish acidified the water to reduce ammonia loading. Ammonia loading, unlike aerial exposure, did not induce glutamine synthesis, and there was no accumulation of glutamine. This is a unique observation different from those reported for other fishes in the literature. An initial switch to partial amino acid catabolism led to the accumulation of alanine and was probably associated with a decreased rate of ammonia production. Aerial exposure led to decreases in rates of ammonia and urea excretion, as well as the accumulation of tissue ammonia. As the internal ammonia levels increased, M. anguillicaudatus was able to excrete some ammonia in the gaseous form (NH3). The percentage of ammonia excreted as NH3 increased with time of exposure and with increasing temperature.

Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [Desert, Lark, Skin, Ceramide, Free fatty acid, Water vapor, Beetle, Mountain pine beetle, Bone, Piezoelectric scaffold, Shark, Wood frog, Mycosporine-like amino acid, Termite, Mound]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2.

Return output in Here's a simplified summary of each text in plain language:\n\n1. **Bird Skin Lipids Adaptation to Desert Environments**\n   - Larks living in hot, dry deserts have less water loss from their skin compared to those in more humid environments.\n   - Instead of having more lipids in their skin (stratum corneum), desert larks have a higher proportion of certain ceramides and fewer free fatty acids. This makes the lipid layers more ordered and creates a tighter barrier against water vapor diffusion, reducing water loss.\n\n2. **Mountain Pine Beetle Flight and Host Colonization**\n   - Female mountain pine beetles that fly longer distances and lose more body mass during flight are less likely to colonize new hosts (trees) but produce more aggregation pheromone.\n   - Male beetles' production of attraction pheromone is affected by their condition after flying, not the energy used during flight.\n   - This variation in flight behavior helps maintain population levels by balancing safe and risky host colonization strategies.\n\n3. **Piezoelectric Scaffold for Adaptive Bone Tissue Engineering**\n   - A new material system is developed that can adapt its mechanical properties in response to external stress.\n   - Piezoelectric scaffolds generate charges when stressed, which induce mineralization from surrounding media, reinforcing regions of high stress or damaged areas.\n   - This self-regenerating material could help address challenges in load-bearing applications by adapting to changing stress conditions.\n\n4. **Daily Variation of UV-Protective Compounds in Marine Dinoflagellate**\n   - The marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae increases its production of UV-absorbing compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids) when exposed to high photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) or PAR plus ultraviolet radiation (UVR).\n   - These compounds help protect the dinoflagellate from UV damage.\n\n5. **Termite Mounds as Passive Ventilation Systems**\n   - Termite mounds in different environments use periodic solar heating to drive internal ventilation, functioning like an external lung for the colony.\n   - Despite differences in gas stratification and overturning patterns, termite architectures can harness solar energy to facilitate gas exchange, with implications for human engineering. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

Although tensilin converts the state of the dermis from soft to standard, it cannot convert from standard to stiff. In this study, we isolated and partially purified a novel stiffening factor from the dermis of Holothuria leucospilota. The factor stiffened the dermis in normal artificial sea water (ASW) but did not stiffen the soft dermis in Ca2+-free ASW. It also stiffened the dermis that had been converted to the standard state in Ca2+-free ASW by the action of tensilin. These results suggest that the factor produces the stiff dermis from the standard state but cannot work as a stiffener on the soft dermis. Its addition to longitudinal muscles of the sea cucumber produced no effects, suggesting that its effect is specific to the catch connective tissue.

Return output in Here's a simplified summary of each text in plain language:\n\n1. **Bird Skin Lipids Adaptation to Desert Environments**\n   - Larks living in hot, dry deserts have less water loss from their skin compared to those in more humid environments.\n   - Instead of having more lipids in their skin (stratum corneum), desert larks have a higher proportion of certain ceramides and fewer free fatty acids. This makes the lipid layers more ordered and creates a tighter barrier against water vapor diffusion, reducing water loss.\n\n2. **Mountain Pine Beetle Flight and Host Colonization**\n   - Female mountain pine beetles that fly longer distances and lose more body mass during flight are less likely to colonize new hosts (trees) but produce more aggregation pheromone.\n   - Male beetles' production of attraction pheromone is affected by their condition after flying, not the energy used during flight.\n   - This variation in flight behavior helps maintain population levels by balancing safe and risky host colonization strategies.\n\n3. **Piezoelectric Scaffold for Adaptive Bone Tissue Engineering**\n   - A new material system is developed that can adapt its mechanical properties in response to external stress.\n   - Piezoelectric scaffolds generate charges when stressed, which induce mineralization from surrounding media, reinforcing regions of high stress or damaged areas.\n   - This self-regenerating material could help address challenges in load-bearing applications by adapting to changing stress conditions.\n\n4. **Daily Variation of UV-Protective Compounds in Marine Dinoflagellate**\n   - The marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae increases its production of UV-absorbing compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids) when exposed to high photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) or PAR plus ultraviolet radiation (UVR).\n   - These compounds help protect the dinoflagellate from UV damage.\n\n5. **Termite Mounds as Passive Ventilation Systems**\n   - Termite mounds in different environments use periodic solar heating to drive internal ventilation, functioning like an external lung for the colony.\n   - Despite differences in gas stratification and overturning patterns, termite architectures can harness solar energy to facilitate gas exchange, with implications for human engineering. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

Experiments show that this spider can identify its preferred prey by sight alone and by odor alone. When presented with two types of size-matched motionless lures, E. culicivora consistently chose blood-fed female mosquitoes in preference to nonmosquito prey, male mosquitoes, and sugar-fed female mosquitoes (i.e., females that had not been feeding on blood). When the choice was between mosquitoes of different sizes (both blood- or both sugar-fed), small juveniles chose the smaller prey, whereas adults and larger juveniles chose the larger prey. However, preference for blood took precedence over preference for size (i.e., to get a blood meal, small individuals took prey that were larger than the preferred size, and larger individuals took prey that were smaller than the preferred size). When presented with odor from two prey types, E. culicivora approached the odor from blood-fed female mosquitoes significantly more often the odor of the prey that were not carrying blood.\",TRUE\n\"A sticky situation: solifugids (Arachnida, Solifugae) use adhesive organs on their pedipalps for prey capture\",\"Solifugids (Arachnida, Solifugae) have unique evertable adhesive organs on the tips of their pedipalps, named \u201a\u00c4\u00f2suctorial\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 or \u201a\u00c4\u00f2palpal\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 organs.

Return output in Here's a simplified summary of each text in plain language:\n\n1. **Bird Skin Lipids Adaptation to Desert Environments**\n   - Larks living in hot, dry deserts have less water loss from their skin compared to those in more humid environments.\n   - Instead of having more lipids in their skin (stratum corneum), desert larks have a higher proportion of certain ceramides and fewer free fatty acids. This makes the lipid layers more ordered and creates a tighter barrier against water vapor diffusion, reducing water loss.\n\n2. **Mountain Pine Beetle Flight and Host Colonization**\n   - Female mountain pine beetles that fly longer distances and lose more body mass during flight are less likely to colonize new hosts (trees) but produce more aggregation pheromone.\n   - Male beetles' production of attraction pheromone is affected by their condition after flying, not the energy used during flight.\n   - This variation in flight behavior helps maintain population levels by balancing safe and risky host colonization strategies.\n\n3. **Piezoelectric Scaffold for Adaptive Bone Tissue Engineering**\n   - A new material system is developed that can adapt its mechanical properties in response to external stress.\n   - Piezoelectric scaffolds generate charges when stressed, which induce mineralization from surrounding media, reinforcing regions of high stress or damaged areas.\n   - This self-regenerating material could help address challenges in load-bearing applications by adapting to changing stress conditions.\n\n4. **Daily Variation of UV-Protective Compounds in Marine Dinoflagellate**\n   - The marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae increases its production of UV-absorbing compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids) when exposed to high photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) or PAR plus ultraviolet radiation (UVR).\n   - These compounds help protect the dinoflagellate from UV damage.\n\n5. **Termite Mounds as Passive Ventilation Systems**\n   - Termite mounds in different environments use periodic solar heating to drive internal ventilation, functioning like an external lung for the colony.\n   - Despite differences in gas stratification and overturning patterns, termite architectures can harness solar energy to facilitate gas exchange, with implications for human engineering. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

Abfrontal cilia and mucocytes were found in all species studied, with types and densities differing within and between gill types. The three species of homorhabdic filibranchs presented different densities of abfrontal cilia and mucocytes, from very dense in M. edulis to sparse in A. zebra. The heterorhabdic gills had intermediate cilia and mucocyte densities, with highest concentrations of both abfrontal cilia and mucocytes on the principal filaments. The eulamellibranchs showed low ciliary densities together with high mucocyte densities, especially in S. solidissima, where the abfrontal mucocytes were glandular. These results indicate that: (1) the abfrontal surface is a vestigial mucociliary surface; (2) the abfrontal surface cannot participate in water pumping in most species, due to low ciliary densities; and (3) species with high densities of abfrontal mucocytes could utilize abfrontal mucus to reduce drag, especially in the highly fused gills, such as those of the eulamellibranchs. The differing distributions of abfrontal cilia and mucocytes may reflect different selective pressures acting on the gills within the various taxa.\",TRUE\nA honey bee odorant receptor for the queen substance 9-oxo-2-decenoic acid,\"By using a functional genomics approach, we have identified a honey bee [Apis mellifera (Am)] odorant receptor (Or) for the queen substance 9-oxo-2-decenoic acid (9-ODA). Honey bees live in large eusocial colonies in which a single queen is responsible for reproduction, several thousand sterile female worker bees complete a myriad of tasks to maintain the colony, and several hundred male drones exist only to mate. The \u201a\u00c4\u00faqueen substance\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 [also termed the queen retinue pheromone (QRP)] is an eight-component pheromone that maintains the queen's dominance in the colony. The main component, 9-ODA, acts as a releaser pheromone by attracting workers to the queen and as a primer pheromone by physiologically inhibiting worker ovary development; it also acts as a sex pheromone, attracting drones\n######################\noutput:"}}

Return output in Here's a simplified summary of each text in plain language:\n\n1. **Bird Skin Lipids Adaptation to Desert Environments**\n   - Larks living in hot, dry deserts have less water loss from their skin compared to those in more humid environments.\n   - Instead of having more lipids in their skin (stratum corneum), desert larks have a higher proportion of certain ceramides and fewer free fatty acids. This makes the lipid layers more ordered and creates a tighter barrier against water vapor diffusion, reducing water loss.\n\n2. **Mountain Pine Beetle Flight and Host Colonization**\n   - Female mountain pine beetles that fly longer distances and lose more body mass during flight are less likely to colonize new hosts (trees) but produce more aggregation pheromone.\n   - Male beetles' production of attraction pheromone is affected by their condition after flying, not the energy used during flight.\n   - This variation in flight behavior helps maintain population levels by balancing safe and risky host colonization strategies.\n\n3. **Piezoelectric Scaffold for Adaptive Bone Tissue Engineering**\n   - A new material system is developed that can adapt its mechanical properties in response to external stress.\n   - Piezoelectric scaffolds generate charges when stressed, which induce mineralization from surrounding media, reinforcing regions of high stress or damaged areas.\n   - This self-regenerating material could help address challenges in load-bearing applications by adapting to changing stress conditions.\n\n4. **Daily Variation of UV-Protective Compounds in Marine Dinoflagellate**\n   - The marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae increases its production of UV-absorbing compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids) when exposed to high photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) or PAR plus ultraviolet radiation (UVR).\n   - These compounds help protect the dinoflagellate from UV damage.\n\n5. **Termite Mounds as Passive Ventilation Systems**\n   - Termite mounds in different environments use periodic solar heating to drive internal ventilation, functioning like an external lung for the colony.\n   - Despite differences in gas stratification and overturning patterns, termite architectures can harness solar energy to facilitate gas exchange, with implications for human engineering. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

Silk proteins are reminiscent of amphiphilic block copolymers containing stretches of polyalanine and glycine-rich polar elements forming a repetitive core flanked by highly conserved non-repetitive amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal domains. The N-terminal domain comprises a secretion signal, but further functions remain unassigned. The C-terminal domain was implicated in the control of solubility and fibre formation initiated by changes in ionic composition and mechanical stimuli known to align the repetitive sequence elements and promote \u0152\u2264-sheet formation. However, despite recent structural data, little is known about this remarkable behaviour in molecular detail. Here we present the solution structure of the C-terminal domain of a spider dragline silk protein and provide evidence that the structural state of this domain is essential for controlled switching between the storage and assembly forms of silk proteins.

A phylogenetic comparison of BW-1 and similar uncultured greigite- and/or magnetite-producing magnetotactic bacteria from freshwater to hypersaline habitats shows that these organisms represent a previously unknown group of sulfate-reducing bacteria in the Deltaproteobacteria. Genomic analysis of BW-1 reveals the presence of two different magnetosome gene clusters, suggesting that one may be responsible for greigite biomineralization and the other for magnetite.\",TRUE\nA dinoflagellate exploits toxins to immobilize prey prior to ingestion,\"Toxins produced by the harmful algal bloom (HAB) forming, mixotrophic dinoflagellate\n######################\noutput:"}}

Return output in Here's a simplified summary of each text in plain language:\n\n1. **Bird Skin Lipids Adaptation to Desert Environments**\n   - Larks living in hot, dry deserts have less water loss from their skin compared to those in more humid environments.\n   - Instead of having more lipids in their skin (stratum corneum), desert larks have a higher proportion of certain ceramides and fewer free fatty acids. This makes the lipid layers more ordered and creates a tighter barrier against water vapor diffusion, reducing water loss.\n\n2. **Mountain Pine Beetle Flight and Host Colonization**\n   - Female mountain pine beetles that fly longer distances and lose more body mass during flight are less likely to colonize new hosts (trees) but produce more aggregation pheromone.\n   - Male beetles' production of attraction pheromone is affected by their condition after flying, not the energy used during flight.\n   - This variation in flight behavior helps maintain population levels by balancing safe and risky host colonization strategies.\n\n3. **Piezoelectric Scaffold for Adaptive Bone Tissue Engineering**\n   - A new material system is developed that can adapt its mechanical properties in response to external stress.\n   - Piezoelectric scaffolds generate charges when stressed, which induce mineralization from surrounding media, reinforcing regions of high stress or damaged areas.\n   - This self-regenerating material could help address challenges in load-bearing applications by adapting to changing stress conditions.\n\n4. **Daily Variation of UV-Protective Compounds in Marine Dinoflagellate**\n   - The marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae increases its production of UV-absorbing compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids) when exposed to high photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) or PAR plus ultraviolet radiation (UVR).\n   - These compounds help protect the dinoflagellate from UV damage.\n\n5. **Termite Mounds as Passive Ventilation Systems**\n   - Termite mounds in different environments use periodic solar heating to drive internal ventilation, functioning like an external lung for the colony.\n   - Despite differences in gas stratification and overturning patterns, termite architectures can harness solar energy to facilitate gas exchange, with implications for human engineering. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [Desert, Lark, Skin, Ceramide, Free fatty acid, Water vapor, Beetle, Mountain pine beetle, Bone, Piezoelectric scaffold, Shark, Wood frog, Mycosporine-like amino acid, Termite, Mound]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2.

Return output in Here's a simplified summary of each text in plain language:\n\n1. **Bird Skin Lipids Adaptation to Desert Environments**\n   - Larks living in hot, dry deserts have less water loss from their skin compared to those in more humid environments.\n   - Instead of having more lipids in their skin (stratum corneum), desert larks have a higher proportion of certain ceramides and fewer free fatty acids. This makes the lipid layers more ordered and creates a tighter barrier against water vapor diffusion, reducing water loss.\n\n2. **Mountain Pine Beetle Flight and Host Colonization**\n   - Female mountain pine beetles that fly longer distances and lose more body mass during flight are less likely to colonize new hosts (trees) but produce more aggregation pheromone.\n   - Male beetles' production of attraction pheromone is affected by their condition after flying, not the energy used during flight.\n   - This variation in flight behavior helps maintain population levels by balancing safe and risky host colonization strategies.\n\n3. **Piezoelectric Scaffold for Adaptive Bone Tissue Engineering**\n   - A new material system is developed that can adapt its mechanical properties in response to external stress.\n   - Piezoelectric scaffolds generate charges when stressed, which induce mineralization from surrounding media, reinforcing regions of high stress or damaged areas.\n   - This self-regenerating material could help address challenges in load-bearing applications by adapting to changing stress conditions.\n\n4. **Daily Variation of UV-Protective Compounds in Marine Dinoflagellate**\n   - The marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae increases its production of UV-absorbing compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids) when exposed to high photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) or PAR plus ultraviolet radiation (UVR).\n   - These compounds help protect the dinoflagellate from UV damage.\n\n5. **Termite Mounds as Passive Ventilation Systems**\n   - Termite mounds in different environments use periodic solar heating to drive internal ventilation, functioning like an external lung for the colony.\n   - Despite differences in gas stratification and overturning patterns, termite architectures can harness solar energy to facilitate gas exchange, with implications for human engineering. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

Evarcha culicivora is an East African jumping spider (Salticidae) that feeds indirectly on vertebrate blood by selecting blood-carrying female mosquitoes as preferred prey. Methodology/Principal Findings By testing with motionless lures made from mounting dead insects in lifelike posture on cork discs, we show that E. culicivora selects Anopheles mosquitoes in preference to other mosquitoes and that this predator can identify Anopheles by static appearance alone. Tests using active (grooming) virtual mosquitoes rendered in 3-D animation show that Anopheles' characteristic resting posture is an important prey-choice cue for E. culicivora. Expression of the spider's preference for Anopheles varies with the spider's size, varies with its prior feeding condition and is independent of the spider gaining a blood meal.

Female pollinating wasps oviposit directly into Ficus ovules from inside the receptive syconium. Across Ficus species, there is a widely documented segregation of pollinator galls in inner ovules and seeds in outer ovules. This pattern suggests that wasps avoid, or are prevented from ovipositing into, outer ovules, and this results in mutualism stability. However, the mechanisms preventing wasps from exploiting outer ovules remain unknown. We report that in Ficus rubiginosa, offspring in outer ovules are vulnerable to attack by parasitic wasps that oviposit from outside the syconium. Parasitism risk decreases towards the centre of the syconium, where inner ovules provide enemy-free space for pollinator offspring.

Return output in Here's a simplified summary of each text in plain language:\n\n1. **Bird Skin Lipids Adaptation to Desert Environments**\n   - Larks living in hot, dry deserts have less water loss from their skin compared to those in more humid environments.\n   - Instead of having more lipids in their skin (stratum corneum), desert larks have a higher proportion of certain ceramides and fewer free fatty acids. This makes the lipid layers more ordered and creates a tighter barrier against water vapor diffusion, reducing water loss.\n\n2. **Mountain Pine Beetle Flight and Host Colonization**\n   - Female mountain pine beetles that fly longer distances and lose more body mass during flight are less likely to colonize new hosts (trees) but produce more aggregation pheromone.\n   - Male beetles' production of attraction pheromone is affected by their condition after flying, not the energy used during flight.\n   - This variation in flight behavior helps maintain population levels by balancing safe and risky host colonization strategies.\n\n3. **Piezoelectric Scaffold for Adaptive Bone Tissue Engineering**\n   - A new material system is developed that can adapt its mechanical properties in response to external stress.\n   - Piezoelectric scaffolds generate charges when stressed, which induce mineralization from surrounding media, reinforcing regions of high stress or damaged areas.\n   - This self-regenerating material could help address challenges in load-bearing applications by adapting to changing stress conditions.\n\n4. **Daily Variation of UV-Protective Compounds in Marine Dinoflagellate**\n   - The marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae increases its production of UV-absorbing compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids) when exposed to high photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) or PAR plus ultraviolet radiation (UVR).\n   - These compounds help protect the dinoflagellate from UV damage.\n\n5. **Termite Mounds as Passive Ventilation Systems**\n   - Termite mounds in different environments use periodic solar heating to drive internal ventilation, functioning like an external lung for the colony.\n   - Despite differences in gas stratification and overturning patterns, termite architectures can harness solar energy to facilitate gas exchange, with implications for human engineering. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

Although all previously described TH-producing biomolecules are proteins, most thermal hysteresis factors (THFs) have not yet been structurally characterized, and none have been characterized from a freeze-tolerant animal. We isolated a highly active THF from the freeze-tolerant beetle, Upis ceramboides, by means of ice affinity.

This makes the lipid layers more ordered and creates a tighter barrier against water vapor diffusion, reducing water loss.\n\n2. **Mountain Pine Beetle Flight and Host Colonization**\n   - Female mountain pine beetles that fly longer distances and lose more body mass during flight are less likely to colonize new hosts (trees) but produce more aggregation pheromone.\n   - Male beetles' production of attraction pheromone is affected by their condition after flying, not the energy used during flight.\n   - This variation in flight behavior helps maintain population levels by balancing safe and risky host colonization strategies.\n\n3. **Piezoelectric Scaffold for Adaptive Bone Tissue Engineering**\n   - A new material system is developed that can adapt its mechanical properties in response to external stress.\n   - Piezoelectric scaffolds generate charges when stressed, which induce mineralization from surrounding media, reinforcing regions of high stress or damaged areas.\n   - This self-regenerating material could help address challenges in load-bearing applications by adapting to changing stress conditions.\n\n4. **Daily Variation of UV-Protective Compounds in Marine Dinoflagellate**\n   - The marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae increases its production of UV-absorbing compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids) when exposed to high photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) or PAR plus ultraviolet radiation (UVR).\n   - These compounds help protect the dinoflagellate from UV damage.\n\n5. **Termite Mounds as Passive Ventilation Systems**\n   - Termite mounds in different environments use periodic solar heating to drive internal ventilation, functioning like an external lung for the colony.\n   - Despite differences in gas stratification and overturning patterns, termite architectures can harness solar energy to facilitate gas exchange, with implications for human engineering. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

Conversely, the nontoxic control strain does not alter its swimming and does not affect prey behavior.

This makes the lipid layers more ordered and creates a tighter barrier against water vapor diffusion, reducing water loss.\n\n2. **Mountain Pine Beetle Flight and Host Colonization**\n   - Female mountain pine beetles that fly longer distances and lose more body mass during flight are less likely to colonize new hosts (trees) but produce more aggregation pheromone.\n   - Male beetles' production of attraction pheromone is affected by their condition after flying, not the energy used during flight.\n   - This variation in flight behavior helps maintain population levels by balancing safe and risky host colonization strategies.\n\n3. **Piezoelectric Scaffold for Adaptive Bone Tissue Engineering**\n   - A new material system is developed that can adapt its mechanical properties in response to external stress.\n   - Piezoelectric scaffolds generate charges when stressed, which induce mineralization from surrounding media, reinforcing regions of high stress or damaged areas.\n   - This self-regenerating material could help address challenges in load-bearing applications by adapting to changing stress conditions.\n\n4. **Daily Variation of UV-Protective Compounds in Marine Dinoflagellate**\n   - The marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae increases its production of UV-absorbing compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids) when exposed to high photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) or PAR plus ultraviolet radiation (UVR).\n   - These compounds help protect the dinoflagellate from UV damage.\n\n5. **Termite Mounds as Passive Ventilation Systems**\n   - Termite mounds in different environments use periodic solar heating to drive internal ventilation, functioning like an external lung for the colony.\n   - Despite differences in gas stratification and overturning patterns, termite architectures can harness solar energy to facilitate gas exchange, with implications for human engineering. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

This display is so vivid that it has been repeatedly confused for bioluminescence, but it is actually the result of scattered light. The flashing occurs on the mantle lip, where electron microscopy revealed two distinct tissue sides: one highly scattering side that contains dense aggregations of spheres composed of silica, and one highly absorbing side that does not. High-speed video confirmed that the two sides act in concert to alternate between vivid broadband reflectance and strong absorption in the blue region of the spectrum. Optical modelling suggests that the diameter of the spheres is nearly optimal for scattering visible light, especially at shorter wavelengths which predominate in their environment. This simple mechanism produces a striking optical effect that may function as a signal.\",TRUE\nA finite element simulation scheme for biological muscular hydrostats.,\"An explicit finite element scheme is developed for biological muscular hydrostats such as squid tentacles, octopus arms and elephant trunks. The scheme is implemented by embedding muscle fibers in finite elements. In any given element, the fiber orientation can be assigned arbitrarily and multiple muscle directions can be simulated. The mechanical stress in each muscle fiber is the sum of active and passive parts. The active stress is taken to be a function of activation state, muscle fiber shortening velocity and fiber strain; while the passive stress depends only on the strain. This scheme is tested by simulating extension of a squid tentacle during prey capture; our numerical predictions are in close correspondence with existing experimental results.

The scheme is implemented by embedding muscle fibers in finite elements. In any given element, the fiber orientation can be assigned arbitrarily and multiple muscle directions can be simulated. The mechanical stress in each muscle fiber is the sum of active and passive parts. The active stress is taken to be a function of activation state, muscle fiber shortening velocity and fiber strain; while the passive stress depends only on the strain. This scheme is tested by simulating extension of a squid tentacle during prey capture; our numerical predictions are in close correspondence with existing experimental results. It is shown that the present finite element scheme can successfully simulate more complex behaviors such as torsion of a squid tentacle and the bending behavior of octopus arms or elephant trunks.\",TRUE\nA functional interpretation of cilia and mucocyte distributions on the abfrontal surface of bivalve gills,\"Abstract The lack of fundamental data on the abfrontal surface of bivalve gills has prompted a comparative study of cilia and mucocytes on this surface, using scanning electron microscopy and histology on eight species of bivalves, representing seven families and the four major gill types: Mytilus edulis, Modiolus modiolus, Arca zebra, Placopecten magellanicus, Crassostrea virginica, Spisula solidissima, Mercenaria mercenaria, and Mya arenaria.

This makes the lipid layers more ordered and creates a tighter barrier against water vapor diffusion, reducing water loss.\n\n2. **Mountain Pine Beetle Flight and Host Colonization**\n   - Female mountain pine beetles that fly longer distances and lose more body mass during flight are less likely to colonize new hosts (trees) but produce more aggregation pheromone.\n   - Male beetles' production of attraction pheromone is affected by their condition after flying, not the energy used during flight.\n   - This variation in flight behavior helps maintain population levels by balancing safe and risky host colonization strategies.\n\n3. **Piezoelectric Scaffold for Adaptive Bone Tissue Engineering**\n   - A new material system is developed that can adapt its mechanical properties in response to external stress.\n   - Piezoelectric scaffolds generate charges when stressed, which induce mineralization from surrounding media, reinforcing regions of high stress or damaged areas.\n   - This self-regenerating material could help address challenges in load-bearing applications by adapting to changing stress conditions.\n\n4. **Daily Variation of UV-Protective Compounds in Marine Dinoflagellate**\n   - The marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae increases its production of UV-absorbing compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids) when exposed to high photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) or PAR plus ultraviolet radiation (UVR).\n   - These compounds help protect the dinoflagellate from UV damage.\n\n5. **Termite Mounds as Passive Ventilation Systems**\n   - Termite mounds in different environments use periodic solar heating to drive internal ventilation, functioning like an external lung for the colony.\n   - Despite differences in gas stratification and overturning patterns, termite architectures can harness solar energy to facilitate gas exchange, with implications for human engineering. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

Therefore, we quantified molecular forces across the essential integrin-binding protein Talin, which links integrin to the actin cytoskeleton. Generating flies expressing 3 F\u221a\u2202rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based Talin tension sensors reporting different force levels between 1 and 11 piconewton (pN) enabled us to quantify physiologically relevant molecular forces. By measuring primary Drosophila muscle cells, we demonstrate that Drosophila Talin experiences mechanical forces in cell culture that are similar to those previously reported for Talin in mammalian cell lines. However, in vivo force measurements at developing flight muscle attachment sites revealed that average forces across Talin are comparatively low and decrease even further while attachments mature and tissue-level tension remains high. Concomitantly, the Talin concentration at attachment sites increases 5-fold as quantified by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), suggesting that only a small proportion of Talin molecules are mechanically engaged at any given time. Reducing Talin levels at late stages of muscle development results in muscle\u201a\u00c4\u00ectendon rupture in the adult fly, likely as a result of active muscle contractions. We therefore propose that a large pool of adhesion molecules is required to share high tissue forces.

Computational and biological systems are often distributed so that processors (cells) jointly solve a task, without any of them receiving all inputs or observing all outputs. Maximal independent set (MIS) selection is a fundamental distributed computing procedure that seeks to elect a set of local leaders in a network. A variant of this problem is solved during the development of the fly\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s nervous system, when sensory organ precursor (SOP) cells are chosen. By studying SOP selection, we derived a fast algorithm for MIS selection that combines two attractive features. First, processors do not need to know their degree; second, it has an optimal message complexity while only using one-bit messages. Our findings suggest that simple and efficient algorithms can be developed on the basis of biologically derived insights.\",TRUE\nA biological sub-micron thickness optical broadband reflector characterized using both light and microwaves,\"Broadband optical reflectors generally function through coherent scattering from systems comprising one of three designs: overlapped; chirped; or chaotic multilayer reflectors. For each, the requirement to scatter a broad band of wavelengths is met through the presence of a variation in nanostructural periodicity running perpendicular to the systems' outer surfaces. Consequently, the requisite total thickness of the multilayer can often be in excess of 50\u201a\u00c4\u00e4\u0152\u00bam. Here, we report the discovery and the microwave-assisted characterization of a natural system that achieves excellent optical broadband reflectivity but that is less than 1\u201a\u00c4\u00e4\u0152\u00bam thick.

Computational and biological systems are often distributed so that processors (cells) jointly solve a task, without any of them receiving all inputs or observing all outputs. Maximal independent set (MIS) selection is a fundamental distributed computing procedure that seeks to elect a set of local leaders in a network. A variant of this problem is solved during the development of the fly\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s nervous system, when sensory organ precursor (SOP) cells are chosen. By studying SOP selection, we derived a fast algorithm for MIS selection that combines two attractive features. First, processors do not need to know their degree; second, it has an optimal message complexity while only using one-bit messages. Our findings suggest that simple and efficient algorithms can be developed on the basis of biologically derived insights.\",TRUE\nA biological sub-micron thickness optical broadband reflector characterized using both light and microwaves,\"Broadband optical reflectors generally function through coherent scattering from systems comprising one of three designs: overlapped; chirped; or chaotic multilayer reflectors. For each, the requirement to scatter a broad band of wavelengths is met through the presence of a variation in nanostructural periodicity running perpendicular to the systems' outer surfaces. Consequently, the requisite total thickness of the multilayer can often be in excess of 50\u201a\u00c4\u00e4\u0152\u00bam. Here, we report the discovery and the microwave-assisted characterization of a natural system that achieves excellent optical broadband reflectivity but that is less than 1\u201a\u00c4\u00e4\u0152\u00bam thick.

Return output in Here's a simplified summary of each text in plain language:\n\n1. **Bird Skin Lipids Adaptation to Desert Environments**\n   - Larks living in hot, dry deserts have less water loss from their skin compared to those in more humid environments.\n   - Instead of having more lipids in their skin (stratum corneum), desert larks have a higher proportion of certain ceramides and fewer free fatty acids. This makes the lipid layers more ordered and creates a tighter barrier against water vapor diffusion, reducing water loss.\n\n2. **Mountain Pine Beetle Flight and Host Colonization**\n   - Female mountain pine beetles that fly longer distances and lose more body mass during flight are less likely to colonize new hosts (trees) but produce more aggregation pheromone.\n   - Male beetles' production of attraction pheromone is affected by their condition after flying, not the energy used during flight.\n   - This variation in flight behavior helps maintain population levels by balancing safe and risky host colonization strategies.\n\n3. **Piezoelectric Scaffold for Adaptive Bone Tissue Engineering**\n   - A new material system is developed that can adapt its mechanical properties in response to external stress.\n   - Piezoelectric scaffolds generate charges when stressed, which induce mineralization from surrounding media, reinforcing regions of high stress or damaged areas.\n   - This self-regenerating material could help address challenges in load-bearing applications by adapting to changing stress conditions.\n\n4. **Daily Variation of UV-Protective Compounds in Marine Dinoflagellate**\n   - The marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae increases its production of UV-absorbing compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids) when exposed to high photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) or PAR plus ultraviolet radiation (UVR).\n   - These compounds help protect the dinoflagellate from UV damage.\n\n5. **Termite Mounds as Passive Ventilation Systems**\n   - Termite mounds in different environments use periodic solar heating to drive internal ventilation, functioning like an external lung for the colony.\n   - Despite differences in gas stratification and overturning patterns, termite architectures can harness solar energy to facilitate gas exchange, with implications for human engineering. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

It appears that air-breathing through the gut is involved, with the anterior portion of the digestive tract playing a central role: it became significantly more alkaline in fish exposed to air or to environmental ammonia. The skin, which also became more alkaline during air exposure, may also be involved in ammonia volatilization in air-exposed fish. This represents the first report of a fish using volatilization of NH3 as part of a defence against ammonia toxicity. It can be concluded that the main strategy adopted by M. anguillicaudatus confronted with ammonia loading or air exposure is to tolerate high ammonia levels in the tissues. During periods of elevated tissue ammonia levels, some ammonia is lost by volatilization via air-breathing using the gut. In addition, some ammonia may be lost across the skin during air exposure.\",TRUE\nAcoustics: In a fly's ear,\"Organisms often identify the source of a sound by comparing the noises that arrive at the two ears.

The African mormyrid fish Gnathonemus petersii can not only detect nearby objects, but in addition can perceive other properties such as their distance, their complex electrical impedance, and their three-dimensional shape. Because most of the sensory signals the fish perceive during their nightly activity period are self-produced, evolution has shaped and adapted the mechanisms for signal production, signal perception and signal analysis by the brain. Like in many other sensory systems, so-called prereceptor mechanisms exist, which passively improve the sensory signals in such a way that the signal carrier is optimized for the extraction of relevant sensory information. In G. petersii prereceptor mechanisms include properties of the animal's skin and internal tissue and the shape of the fish's body. These lead to a specific design of the signal carrier at different skin regions of\n######################\noutput:"}}

In G. petersii prereceptor mechanisms include properties of the animal's skin and internal tissue and the shape of the fish's body. These lead to a specific design of the signal carrier at different skin regions of the fish, preparing them to perform certain detection tasks. Prereceptor mechanisms also ensure that the moveable skin appendix of G. petersii, the 'Schnauzenorgan', receives an optimal sensory signal during all stages of its movement. Another important aspect of active sensing in G. petersii concerns the locomotor strategies during electrolocation. When foraging, the animals adopt a particular position with the body slanted forward bringing the so-called 'nasal region' in a position to examine the environment in front of and at the side of the fish. Simultaneously, the Schnauzenorgan performs rhythmic left-right searching movements. When an object of interest is encountered, the Schnauzenorgan is brought in a twitching movement towards the object and is moved over it for further exploration. The densities of electroreceptor organs is extraordinary high at the Schnauzenorgan and, to a lesser extend, at the nasal region. In these so-called foveal regions, the mormyromasts have a different morphology compared to other parts of the electroreceptive skin. Our results on mormyromast density and morphology, prereceptor mechanisms and electric images, central processing of electroreceptive information, and on behavioural strategies of G. petersii lead us to formulate the hypothesis that these fish possess two separate electric foveae, each of which is specialized for certain perceptional tasks.\",TRUE\nActive-site properties of Phrixotrix railroad worm green and red bioluminescence-eliciting luciferases,\"The luciferases of the railroad worm Phrixotrix (Coleoptera: Phengodidae) are the only beetle luciferases that naturally produce true red bioluminescence.

The osmotic influx and efflux of water in living cells can cause a rapid movement of organs in a predetermined direction. Even dead tissue can be actuated by a swelling or drying of the plant cell walls. The deformation of the organ is controlled at different levels of tissue hierarchy by geometrical constraints at the micrometre level (e.g. cell shape and size) and cell wall polymer composition at the nanoscale (e.g. cellulose fibril orientation). This paper reviews different mechanisms of organ movement in plants and highlights recent research in the field. Particular attention is paid to systems that are activated without any metabolism. The design principles of such systems may be particularly useful for a biomimetic translation into active technical composites and moving devices.,TRUE\nAdaptable Defense: A Nudibranch Mucus Inhibits Nematocyst Discharge and Changes With Prey Type,\"Nudibranchs that feed on cnidarians must defend themselves from the prey\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s nematocysts or risk their own injury or death.

While a nudibranch\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s mucus has been thought to protect the animal from nematocyst discharge, an inhibition of discharge by nudibranch mucus has never been shown. The current study investigated whether mucus from the aeolid nudibranch Aeolidia papillosa would inhibit nematocyst discharge from four species of sea anemone prey. Sea anemone tentacles were contacted with mucus-coated gelatin probes, and nematocyst discharge was quantified and compared with control probes of gelatin only. Mucus from A. papillosa inhibited the discharge of nematocysts from sea anemone tentacles. This inhibition was specifically limited to the anemone species on which the nudibranch had been feeding. When the prey species was changed, the mucus changed within 2 weeks to inhibit the nematocyst discharge of the new prey species. The nudibranchs apparently produce the inhibitory mucus rather than simply becoming coated in anemone mucus during feeding. Because of the intimate association between most aeolid nudibranchs and their prey, an adaptable mucus protection could have a significant impact on the behavior, distribution, and life history of the nudibranchs.\",TRUE\n\"Adaptation to life in aeolian sand: how the sandfish lizard, Scincus scincus, prevents sand particles from entering its lungs\",\"ABSTRACT The sandfish lizard, Scincus scincus (Squamata: Scincidae), spends nearly its whole life in aeolian sand and only comes to the surface for foraging, defecating and mating. It is not yet understood how the animal can respire without sand particles entering its respiratory organs when buried under thick layers of sand. In this work, we integrated biological studies, computational calculations and physical experiments to understand this phenomenon. We present a 3D model of the upper respiratory system based on a detailed histological analysis. A 3D-printed version of this model was used in combination with characteristic ventilation patterns for computational calculations and fluid mechanics experiments. By calculating the velocity field, we identified a sharp decrease in velocity in the anterior part of the nasal cavity where mucus and cilia are present. The experiments with the 3D-printed model validate the calculations: particles, if present, were found only in the same area as suggested by the\n######################\noutput:"}}

We hypothesized that this feeding environment might promote nutrient acquisition by the branchial and epidermal epithelia. The potential for Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii, to absorb amino acids from the environment across the skin and gill was thus investigated. l-alanine and glycine were absorbed via specific transport pathways across both gill and skin surfaces, the first such documentation of direct organic nutrient acquisition in a vertebrate animal. Uptake occurred via distinct mechanisms with respect to concentration dependence, sodium dependence and effects of putative transport inhibitors across each epithelium. Significant differences in the absorbed amino acid distribution between the skin of juveniles and adults were noted. The ability to absorb dissolved organic matter across the skin and gill may be an adaptation to a scavenging lifestyle, allowing hagfish to maximize sporadic opportunities for organic nutrient acquisition. From an evolutionary perspective, hagfish represent a transitory state between the generalized nutrient absorption pathways of aquatic invertebrates and the more specialized digestive systems of aquatic vertebrates.\",TRUE\nAdaptive Advantages of Cooperative Courtship for Subordinate Male Lance\u201a\u00c4\u00eaTailed Manakins,\"Male lance\u201a\u00c4\u00eatailed manakins (Chiroxiphia lanceolata) cooperate in complex courtship displays, but the dominant (alpha) partner monopolizes mating opportunities.

I demonstrated that beta males rarely sired chicks and were unrelated to their alpha partners but received delayed direct benefits from cooperation; betas had an increased probability of becoming an alpha when compared to males that had not been betas. To investigate the mechanism by which betas attain these adaptive benefits, I examined betas\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 success in replacing their alpha partners both in natural turnover events and when alphas were experimentally removed. Beta males did not consistently inherit alpha roles in the same territories where they served their beta tenure, arguing that queuing for status does not fully explain the benefits of cooperation for betas. Instead, betas may be apprenticing to develop effective and appropriate displays that enhance their subsequent success as alphas.

There is little direct evidence, however, that novel chemical traits arising from gene duplication reduce herbivory. Higher plants use threonine deaminase (TD) to catalyze the dehydration of threonine (Thr) to \u0152\u00b1-ketobutyrate and ammonia as the committed step in the biosynthesis of isoleucine (Ile). Cultivated tomato and related Solanum species contain a duplicated TD paralog (TD2) that is coexpressed with a suite of genes involved in herbivore resistance. Analysis of TD2-deficient tomato lines showed that TD2 has a defensive function related to Thr catabolism in the gut of lepidopteran herbivores. During herbivory, the regulatory domain of TD2 is removed by proteolysis to generate a truncated protein (pTD2) that efficiently degrades Thr without being inhibited by Ile. We show that this proteolytic activation step occurs in the gut of lepidopteran but not coleopteran herbivores, and is catalyzed by a\n######################\noutput:"}}

We show that this proteolytic activation step occurs in the gut of lepidopteran but not coleopteran herbivores, and is catalyzed by a chymotrypsin-like protease of insect origin. Analysis of purified recombinant enzymes showed that TD2 is remarkably more resistant to proteolysis and high temperature than the ancestral TD1 isoform. The crystal structure of pTD2 provided evidence that electrostatic interactions constitute a stabilizing feature associated with adaptation of TD2 to the extreme environment of the lepidopteran gut.

A cluster of these terminal plates contacting a substrate surface generates strong attractive forces that hold the insect on smooth surfaces. Previous research assumed that cohesive forces and molecular adhesion were involved in the fly attachment mechanism. The main elements that contribute to the overall attachment force, however, remained unknown. Multiple local force\u201a\u00c4\u00ecvolume measurements were performed on individual terminal plates by using atomic force microscopy. It was shown that the geometry of a single terminal plate had a higher border and considerably lower centre. Local adhesion was approximately twice as strong in the centre of the plate as on its border. Adhesion of fly footprints on a glass surface, recorded within 20 min after preparation, was similar to adhesion in the centre of a single attachment pad. Adhesion strongly decreased with decreasing volume of footprint fluid, indicating that the layer of pad secretion covering the terminal plates is crucial for the generation of a strong attractive force. Our data provide the first direct evidence that, in addition to Van der Waals and Coulomb forces, attractive capillary forces, mediated by pad secretion, are a critical factor in the fly's attachment mechanism.\",TRUE\nAdhesion of single bacterial cells in the micronewton range.,\"The adhesion of bacteria to surfaces plays critical roles in the environment, disease, and industry.

By retaining insects that strike the web, these spirally arrayed threads allow a spider time to locate and subdue prey. The viscous capture threads spun by modern orb-weaving spiders of the Araneoidea clade replaced the dry, fuzzy cribellar capture threads of the Deinopoidea and feature regularly spaced moist, adhesive droplets. The stickiness of a cribellar thread is limited by its tendency to peel from a surface after the adhesion generated at the edges of contact is exceeded. In this study we test the hypothesis that viscous thread overcomes this limitation by implementing a suspension bridge mechanism (SBM) that recruits the adhesion of multiple thread droplets. We do so by using contact plates of four widths to measure the stickiness of six species' viscous threads whose profiles range from small, closely spaced droplets to large, widely spaced droplets. The increased stickiness registered by an increased number of thread droplets supports the operation of a SBM. However, the accompanying decrease in mean per droplet adhesion shows that droplets interior to the edges of thread contact contribute successively less adhesion. Models developed from these data suggest that the suspension bridge mechanism is limited to a span of approximately 12 droplets.\",TRUE\nAerial roots of epiphytic orchids: the velamen radicum and its role in water and nutrient uptake,\"The velamen rad\n######################\noutput:"}}

The sugar gliders in this study accelerated downward slightly (1.0\u00ac\u00b10.5 m s\u201a\u00c4\u00ec2), and also accelerated forward (2.1\u00ac\u00b10.6 m s\u201a\u00c4\u00ec2) in all but one trial, indicating that the body weight was not fully supported by aerodynamic forces and that some of the lift produced forward acceleration rather than just balancing body weight.

Movements of the limbs were strongly correlated with body rotations, suggesting that sugar gliders make extensive use of limb movements to control their orientation during gliding flight. In addition, among individuals, different limb movements were associated with a given body rotation, suggesting that individual variation exists in the control of body rotations. Under similar conditions, flying squirrels generated higher lift coefficients and lower drag coefficients than sugar gliders, yet had only marginally shallower glides. Flying squirrels have a number of morphological specializations not shared by sugar gliders that may help to explain their greater lift generating performance.\",TRUE\n\"Aerodynamic force generation, performance and control of body orientation during gliding in sugar gliders (Petaurus breviceps)\",\"SUMMARY Gliding has often been discussed in the literature as a possible precursor to powered flight in vertebrates, but few studies exist on the mechanics of gliding in living animals.

Yet, quantitative evidence for the alleged functions, e.g., efficient water and nutrient uptake, nutrient retention, reduction of water loss, mechanical protection, or the avoidance of overheating, is rare or missing. We tested the notion originally put forward by Went in 1940 that the velamen allows plants to capture and immobilize the first solutions arriving in a rainfall, which are the most heavily charged with nutrients. In a series of experiments, we examined whether all necessary functional characteristics are given for this scenario to be realistic under ecological conditions. First, we show that the velamen of a large number of orchid species takes up solutions within seconds, while evaporation from the velamen takes several hours. Charged ions are retained in the velamen probably due to positive and negative charges in the cell walls, while uncharged compounds are lost to the external medium. Finally, we demonstrate that nutrient uptake follows biphasic kinetics with a highly efficient, active transport system at low external concentrations. Thus, our results lend strong support to Went\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s hypothesis: the velamen fulfills an important function in nutrient uptake in the epiphytic habitat. Most of the other functions outlined above still await similar experimental scrutiny.\",TRUE\n\"Aerodynamic force generation, performance and control of body orientation during gliding in sugar gliders (Petaurus breviceps)\",\"SUMMARY Gliding has often been discussed in the literature as a possible precursor to powered flight in vertebrates, but few studies exist on the mechanics of gliding in living animals.

Short segments of the glide were captured on video, and the positions of marked anatomical landmarks were used to compute linear distances and angles, as well as whole body velocities and accelerations. From the whole body accelerations I estimated the aerodynamic forces generated by the animals. I computed the correlations between movements of the limbs and body rotations to examine the control of orientation during flight. Finally, I compared these results to those of my earlier study on the similarly sized and distantly related southern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans). The sugar gliders in this study accelerated downward slightly (1.0\u00ac\u00b10.5 m s\u201a\u00c4\u00ec2), and also accelerated forward (2.1\u00ac\u00b10.6 m s\u201a\u00c4\u00ec2) in all but one trial, indicating that the body weight was not fully supported by aerodynamic forces and that some of the lift produced forward acceleration rather than just balancing body weight. The gliders used high angles of attack (44.15\u00ac\u00b13.12\u00ac\u221e), far higher than the angles at which airplane wings would stall, yet generated higher lift coefficients (1.48\u00ac\u00b10.18) than would be expected for a stalled wing. Movements of the limbs were strongly correlated with body rotations, suggesting that sugar gliders make extensive use of limb movements to control their orientation during gliding flight. In addition, among individuals, different limb movements were associated with a given body rotation, suggesting that individual variation exists in the control of body rotations. Under similar conditions, flying squirrels generated higher lift coefficients and lower drag coefficients than sugar gliders, yet had only marginally shallower glides. Flying squirrels have a number of morphological specializations not shared by sugar gliders that may help to explain their greater lift generating performance.\",TRUE\nAerodynamics of saccate pollen and its implications for wind pollination,\"Pollen grains of many wind-pollinated plants contain 1-3 air-filled bladders, or sacci.

The model calculates terminal settling velocity based on structural characters of the pollen grain, including lengths, widths, and depths of the main body and sacci; angle of saccus rotation; and thicknesses of the saccus wall, endoreticulations, intine, and exine. The settling speeds predicted by the model were empirically validated by stroboscopic photography. This study is the first to quantitatively demonstrate the adaptive significance of sacci for the aerodynamics of wind pollination. Modeling pollen both with and without sacci indicated that sacci can reduce pollen settling speeds, thereby increasing dispersal distance, with the exception of pollen grains having robust endoreticulations and those with thick saccus walls. Furthermore, because the mathematical model is based on structural characters and error propagation methods show that the model yields valid results when sample sizes are small, the flight dynamics of fossil pollen can be investigated. Several fossils were studied, including bisaccate (Pinus, Pteruchus, Caytonanthus), monosaccate (Gothania), and nonsaccate (Monoletes) pollen types.\",TRUE\nAerodynamics of the hovering hummingbird,\"Despite profound musculoskeletal differences, hummingbirds (Trochilidae) are widely thought to employ aerodynamic mechanisms similar to those used by insects. The kinematic symmetry of the hummingbird upstroke and downstroke has led to the assumption that these halves of the wingbeat cycle contribute equally to weight support during hovering, as exhibited by insects of similar size. This assumption has been applied, either explicitly or implicitly, in widely used aerodynamic models and in a variety of empirical tests. Here we provide measurements of the wake of hovering rufous hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus) obtained with digital particle image velocimetry that show force asymmetry: hummingbirds produce 75% of their weight support during the downstroke and only 25% during the upstroke. Some of this asymmetry is probably due to inversion of their cambered wings during upstroke. The wake of hummingbird wings also reveals evidence of leading-edge vortices created during the downstroke, indicating that\n######################\noutput:"}}

How the ordered structure of aragonite layers is achieved has been unclear. Suzuki et al. (p. 1388, published online 13 August 2009; see the Perspective by Kr\u221a\u2202ger) identified two acidic matrix proteins (Pif 97 and Pif 80) that regulate nacre formation in the Japanese pearl oyster. The proteins appear to form a complex in which Pif 80 binds to aragonite and Pif 97 binds to other macromolecules in the organic matrix. A matrix protein is identified that regulates nacre formation in the Japanese pearl oyster. The mollusk shell is a hard tissue consisting of calcium carbonate crystals and an organic matrix. The nacre of the shell is characterized by a stacked compartment structure with a uniformly oriented c axis of aragonite crystals in each compartment. Using a calcium carbonate\u201a\u00c4\u00ecbinding assay, we identified an acidic matrix protein, Pif, in the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata that specifically binds to aragonite crystals. The Pif complementary DNA (cDNA) encoded a precursor protein, which was posttranslationally cleaved to produce Pif 97 and Pif 80. The results from immunolocalization, a knockdown experiment that used RNA interference, and in vitro calcium carbonate crystallization studies strongly indicate that Pif regulates nacre formation.\",TRUE\nAn exceptionally fast actomyosin reaction powers insect flight muscle,\"Insects, as a group, have been remarkably successful in adapting to a great range of physical and biological environments, in large part because of their ability to fly. The evolution of flight in small insects was accompanied by striking adaptations of the thoracic musculature that enabled very high wing beat frequencies. At the cellular and protein filament level, a stretch activation mechanism evolved that allowed high-oscillatory work to be achieved at very high frequencies as contraction and nerve stimulus became asynchronous. At the molecular level, critical adaptations occurred within the motor protein myosin II, because its elementary interactions with actin set the speed of sarcomere contraction. Here, we show that the key myosin enzymatic adaptations required for powering the very fast flight muscles in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster include the highest measured detachment rate of myosin from actin (forward rate constant, 3,698 s\u201a\u00e0\u00ed1), an exceptionally weak affinity of\n######################\noutput:"}}

In such systems individual cells can switch to an alternative state and, after some time, switch back again. In Bacillus subtilis, competence is an example of such a transiently differentiated state associated with the capability for DNA uptake from the environment. Individual genes and proteins underlying differentiation into the competent state have been identified, but it has been unclear how these genes interact dynamically in individual cells to control both spontaneous entry into competence and return to vegetative growth. Here we show that this behaviour can be understood in terms of excitability in the underlying genetic circuit. Using quantitative fluorescence time-lapse microscopy, we directly observed the activities of multiple circuit components simultaneously in individual cells, and analysed the resulting data in terms of a mathematical model. We find that an excitable core module containing positive and negative feedback loops can explain both entry into, and exit from, the competent state. We further tested this model by analysing initiation in sister cells, and by re-engineering the gene circuit to specifically block exit. Excitable dynamics driven by noise naturally generate stochastic and transient responses, thereby providing an ideal mechanism for competence regulation.\",TRUE\nAn experimental test of the contributions and condition dependence of microstructure and carotenoids in yellow plumage coloration,\"A combination of structural and pigmentary components is responsible for many of the colour displays of animals.

Nature has accomplished this feat through the precise control of anisotropic crystal nucleation and growth processes in conjunction with nanoscale control over the self-assembly of spatially distinct organic and inorganic phases, resulting in effective inhibition of crack propagation through these materials. One such example is found in the hyper-mineralized and abrasion resistant radular teeth of the chitons, a group of herbivorous marine mollusks who have the surprising capacity to erode away the rocky substrates on which they graze 1-4 . Through the use of modern microscopy and nanomechanical characterization techniques, we describe the architectural and mechanical properties of the radular teeth from Cryptochiton stelleri. Chiton teeth are shown to exhibit the largest hardness and stiffness of any biominerals reported to date, being notably as much as three-fold harder than human enamel and the calcium carbonate-based shells of mollusks. We explain how the unique multi-phasic design of these materials contributes not only to their functionality, but also highlights some interesting design principles that might be applied to the fabrication of synthetic composites.\",TRUE\nAnatomical significance of the hygrochastic movement in Anastatica hierochuntica,\"Background and aims:                    Unlike the dispersal mechanisms of many desert plants, the whole dead skeleton of Anastatica hierochuntica is involved in seed dispersal and preservation.

Previously hypothesized to produce a blue colour by incoherent, Tyndall scattering, the scales of Papilio zalmoxis are not appropriately nanostructured for incoherent scattering. Rather, available data indicate that the blue of P. zalmoxis is a fluorescent pigmentary colour. Despite their nanoscale anatomical diversity, all structurally coloured butterfly scales share a single fundamental physical color production mechanism - coherent scattering.

However, the specialized mutualistic mirid bug Pameridea roridulae lives and walks on this sticky plant surface without being trapped. We have sought to reveal the mechanism underlying the apparent non-sticky nature of the cuticle of this bug. In this study, we have visualized intact plant and insect surfaces using cryo-scanning electron microscopy and measured the adhesive properties of the plant secretion on different surfaces. We present a combination of structural and experimental results that suggest that a thick and cohesively weak film of an outermost, epicuticular greasy secretion acts as a `sloughing-off' layer, preventing the formation of contacts between the sticky plant secretion and the solid insect cuticle. In a comparative study of fresh cuticle fractures of flies representing a typical prey of R. gorgonias, a thin, fragmentary layer of epicuticular grease was revealed. These results indicate that, when trapping prey, the plant adhesive might form proper contact with solid islands of the insect cuticle that are free of epicuticular grease.\",TRUE\nAn Intertidal Sea Star Adjusts Thermal Inertia to Avoid Extreme Body Temperatures,\"The body temperature of ectotherms is influenced by the interaction of abiotic conditions, morphology, and behavior.

An anatomical interpretation of this mechanical movement was investigated.METHODSAn anatomical study of the stem was conducted on the juvenile plants raised under different water treatments and on the branch-orders of adult A. hierochuntica size-classes.KEY RESULTSIn the juvenile stem of A. hierochuntica, the area of cortex, conducting tissue and pith increased with water availability. However, the hydraulic conductance decreased, resulting in a better withdrawal of water in water-stressed plants. The anatomical investigation of the hygrochastic mechanism revealed an asymmetric distribution of the cortical tissues, with the conducting tissues of the stem of juvenile and adult plants being larger in the lower side. The hydraulic conductance was better in the basal and middle branch-orders than the terminal ones, permitting better conductance of water to the subsequent branch-orders.CONCLUSIONSThe lignified conducting tissue of the whole stem, having a hygrochastic nature, controls the movement of the branches. The greater amount of conducting tissue associated with a higher density of wide xylem vessels was observed in the lower side of the stem as compared with the upper side. Consequently, the conducting tissue in the lower side of the stem was suggested to be more effective in the opening process of the curled dry branches through better and more rapid conductance of water. Alternatively, due to the few narrow xylem vessels in the upper side of the stem, it was likely that the conducting tissue in the upper side is more effective in the closing process by providing more rapid drying. The mechanical rise of water and the related hygrochastic efficiency were maximized in the basal and middle branch-orders that are mostly involved in the mechanical movement.\",TRUE\nAnatomically diverse butterfly scales all produce structural colours by coherent scattering,\"SUMMARY The structural colours of butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) have been attributed to a diversity of physical mechanisms, including multilayer interference, diffraction, Bragg scattering, Tyndall scattering and Rayleigh scattering. We used fibre optic spectrophotometry, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and 2D Fourier analysis to investigate the physical mechanisms of structural colour production in twelve lepidopteran species from four families, representing all of the previously proposed anatomical and optical classes of butterfly nanostructure. The 2D Fourier analyses of TEMs of colour producing butterfly scales document that all species are appropriately nanostructured to produce visible colours by coherent scattering, i.e. differential interference and reinforcement of scattered, visible wavelengths.\n######################\noutput:"}}

Using presentations of 15 species of live predators, we show that acoustic features of the mobbing calls of black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapilla) vary with the size of the predator. Companion playback experiments revealed that chickadees detect this information and that the intensity of mobbing behavior is related to the size and threat of the potential predator.

The two mechanisms that limpets are known to use, suction and glue-like adhesion, were distinguished by measuring the limpets' attachment forces in shear and by staining for glue-like residues where the limpets had been attached. The results show that \u201a\u00e2\u00e0 73% of limpets at high tide use suction, while the rest use glue-like adhesion. Conversely, \u201a\u00e2\u00e0 75% of limpets at low tide use glue-like adhesion, while the rest use suction. The normal tenacity of limpets was also measured at high and low tide. The mean tenacity at high tide was significantly less than that at low tide. From these data it was estimated that the mean tenacity of glue-like adhesion is \u201a\u00e2\u00e0 0.23 MN\u00ac\u2211m\u201a\u00e0\u00ed2 and the mean tenacity of suction adhesion is \u201a\u00e2\u00e0 0.09 MN\u00ac\u2211m\u201a\u00e0\u00ed2.

Despite the ubiquity of this type of coloration, neither the relative contribution of structures and pigments to variation in such colour displays nor the relative effects of extrinsic factors on the structural and pigment-based components of such colour has been determined. Understanding the sources of colour variation is important because structures and pigments may convey different information to conspecifics. In an experiment on captive American goldfinches Carduelis tristis, we manipulated two parameters, carotenoid availability and food availability, known to affect the expression of carotenoid pigments in a full-factorial design. Yellow feathers from these birds were then analysed in two ways. First, we used full-spectrum spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography to examine the extent to which variation in white structural colour and total carotenoid content was associated with variation in colour properties of feathers. The carotenoid content of yellow feathers predicted two colour parameters (principal component 1\u201a\u00c4\u00eerepresenting high values of ultraviolet and yellow chroma and low values of violet\u201a\u00c4\u00ecblue chroma\u201a\u00c4\u00eeand hue). Two different colour parameters (violet\u201a\u00c4\u00ecblue and yellow chroma) from white de-pigmented feathers, as well as carotenoid content, predicted reflectance measurements from yellow feathers. Second, we determined the relative effects of our experimental manipulations on white structural colour and yellow colour. Carotenoid availability directly affected yellow colour, while food availability affected it only in combination with carotenoid availability. None of our manipulations had significant effects on the expression of white structural colour. Our results suggest that the contribution of microstructures to variation in the expression of yellow coloration is less than the contribution of carotenoid content, and that carotenoid deposition is more dependent on extrinsic variability than is the production of white structural colour.\",TRUE\nAn insect trap as habitat: cohesion-failure mechanism prevents adhesion of Pameridea roridulae bugs to the sticky surface of the plant Roridula gorgonias,\"SUMMARY The glandular trichomes of the plant Roridula gorgonias release an extremely adhesive, visco-elastic, resinous secretion that traps a variety of insects, including those having a considerable body size.

However, their structure\u201a\u00c4\u00ecactivity relationships and mechanisms of action against fungal pathogens of plants are still largely unknown. A small highly cationic peptide NCR044 with potent antifungal activity has been identified. This peptide has a unique highly dynamic structure and exhibits multifaceted mechanisms of action against a fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Exogenous application of this peptide confers resistance to a gray mold disease caused by B. cinerea in tobacco and tomato plants as well as postharvest products. Our work paves the way for future development of NCR peptides as spray-on antifungal agents. In the indeterminate nodules of a model legume Medicago truncatula, \u201a\u00e0\u00ba700 nodule-specific cysteine-rich (NCR) peptides with conserved cysteine signature are expressed. NCR peptides are highly diverse in sequence, and some of these cationic peptides exhibit antimicrobial activity in vitro and in vivo.

During a tandem run, a single leader teaches one follower the route to important resources such as sources of food or better nest sites. In the present study, we investigate what tandem leaders and followers do, in the context of nest emigration, if their partner goes missing. Our experiments involved removing either leaders or followers at set points during tandem runs. Former leaders first stand still and wait for their missing follower but then most often proceed alone to the new nest site. By contrast, former followers often first engage in a Brownian search, for almost exactly the time that their former leader should have waited for them, and then former followers switch to a superdiffusive search. In this way, former followers first search their immediate neighbourhood for their lost leader before becoming ever more wide ranging so that in the absence of their former leader they can often find the new nest, re-encounter the old one or meet a new leader. We also show that followers gain useful information even from incomplete tandem runs. These observations point to the important principle that sophisticated communication behaviours may have evolved as anytime algorithms, i.e. procedures that are beneficial even if they do not run to completion.\",TRUE\nAnt semiochemicals limit apterous aphid dispersal,\"Some organisms can manipulate the nervous systems of others or alter their physiology in order to obtain benefit. Ants are known to limit alate aphid dispersal by physically removing wings and also through chemical manipulation of the alate developmental pathway. This results in reduced dispersal and higher local densities of aphids, which benefit ants in terms of increased honeydew and prey availability. Here, we show that the walking movement of mutualistic apterous aphids is also reduced by ant semiochemicals. Aphids walk slower and their dispersal from an unsuitable patch is hampered by ants. If aphid walking dispersal has evolved as a means of natural enemy escape, then ant chemicals may act as a signal indicating protection; hence, reduced dispersal could be adaptive for aphids. If, however, dispersal is\n######################\noutput:"}}

In order to prove such an anti-contamination hypothesis of these structures, we measured the adhesive properties of polymer moulds of insect ommatidia, and compared these data with control surfaces having the same curvature radii but lacking such a nanostructure. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) study and force measurements using an atomic force microscope (AFM) on the eye surfaces of three different insect species, dragonfly Aeshna mixta (Odonata), moth Laothoe populi (Lepidoptera) and fly Volucella pellucens (Diptera), were undertaken. We revealed that adhesion is greatly reduced by corneal grating in L. populi and V. pellucens when compared with their smooth controls. The smooth cornea of A. mixta showed no statistically significant difference to its control. We assume that this anti-adhesive phenomenon is due to a decrease in the real contact area between contaminating particles and the eye's surface. Such a combination of three functions in one nanostructure can be interesting for the development of industrial multifunctional surfaces capable of enhancing light harvesting while reducing light reflection and adhesion.\",TRUE\n\"An Acidic Matrix Protein, Pif, Is a Key Macromolecule for Nacre Formation\",\"Making Mother of Pearl Nacre is an iridescent layer of calcium carbonate lining the inside of shells of marine mollusks and is commonly known as \u201a\u00c4\u00famother of pearl.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 It is composed of layers of uniformly oriented crystals of aragonite (a metastable form of calcium carbonate) separated by layers of organic matrix.

Using scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy, mathematical modeling, and the saccate pollen of three extant conifers with structurally different pollen grains (Pinus, Falcatifolium, Dacrydium), we developed a computational model to investigate pollen flight. The model calculates terminal settling velocity based on structural characters of the pollen grain, including lengths, widths, and depths of the main body and sacci; angle of saccus rotation; and thicknesses of the saccus wall, endoreticulations, intine, and exine. The settling speeds predicted by the model were empirically validated by stroboscopic photography. This study is the first to quantitatively demonstrate the adaptive significance of sacci for the aerodynamics of wind pollination. Modeling pollen both with and without sacci indicated that sacci can reduce pollen settling speeds, thereby increasing dispersal distance, with the exception of pollen grains having robust endoreticulations and those with thick saccus walls. Furthermore, because the mathematical model is based on structural characters and error propagation methods show that the model yields valid results when sample sizes are small, the flight dynamics of fossil pollen can be investigated. Several fossils were studied, including bisaccate (Pinus, Pteruchus, Caytonanthus), monosaccate (Gothania), and nonsaccate (Monoletes) pollen types.\",TRUE\nAerodynamics of the hovering hummingbird,\"Despite profound musculoskeletal differences, hummingbirds (Trochilidae) are widely thought to employ aerodynamic mechanisms similar to those used by insects. The kinematic symmetry of the hummingbird upstroke and downstroke has led to the assumption that these halves of the wingbeat cycle contribute equally to weight support during hovering, as exhibited by insects of similar size. This assumption has been applied, either explicitly or implicitly, in widely used aerodynamic models and in a variety of empirical tests. Here we provide measurements of the wake of hovering rufous hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus) obtained with digital particle image velocimetry that show force asymmetry: hummingbirds produce 75% of their weight support during the downstroke and only 25% during the upstroke. Some of this asymmetry is probably due to inversion of their cambered wings during upstroke. The wake of hummingbird wings also reveals evidence of leading-edge vortices created during the downstroke, indicating that\n######################\noutput:"}}

Yet, quantitative evidence for the alleged functions, e.g., efficient water and nutrient uptake, nutrient retention, reduction of water loss, mechanical protection, or the avoidance of overheating, is rare or missing. We tested the notion originally put forward by Went in 1940 that the velamen allows plants to capture and immobilize the first solutions arriving in a rainfall, which are the most heavily charged with nutrients. In a series of experiments, we examined whether all necessary functional characteristics are given for this scenario to be realistic under ecological conditions. First, we show that the velamen of a large number of orchid species takes up solutions within seconds, while evaporation from the velamen takes several hours. Charged ions are retained in the velamen probably due to positive and negative charges in the cell walls, while uncharged compounds are lost to the external medium. Finally, we demonstrate that nutrient uptake follows biphasic kinetics with a highly efficient, active transport system at low external concentrations. Thus, our results lend strong support to Went\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s hypothesis: the velamen fulfills an important function in nutrient uptake in the epiphytic habitat. Most of the other functions outlined above still await similar experimental scrutiny.\",TRUE\n\"Aerodynamic force generation, performance and control of body orientation during gliding in sugar gliders (Petaurus breviceps)\",\"SUMMARY Gliding has often been discussed in the literature as a possible precursor to powered flight in vertebrates, but few studies exist on the mechanics of gliding in living animals.

Short segments of the glide were captured on video, and the positions of marked anatomical landmarks were used to compute linear distances and angles, as well as whole body velocities and accelerations. From the whole body accelerations I estimated the aerodynamic forces generated by the animals.

We show that this proteolytic activation step occurs in the gut of lepidopteran but not coleopteran herbivores, and is catalyzed by a chymotrypsin-like protease of insect origin. Analysis of purified recombinant enzymes showed that TD2 is remarkably more resistant to proteolysis and high temperature than the ancestral TD1 isoform. The crystal structure of pTD2 provided evidence that electrostatic interactions constitute a stabilizing feature associated with adaptation of TD2 to the extreme environment of the lepidopteran gut. These findings demonstrate a role for gene duplication in the evolution of a plant defense that targets and co-opts herbivore digestive physiology.\",TRUE\nAdhesion forces measured at the level of a terminal plate of the fly's seta,\"The attachment pads of fly legs are covered with setae, each ending in small terminal plates coated with secretory fluid. A cluster of these terminal plates contacting a substrate surface generates strong attractive forces that hold the insect on smooth surfaces. Previous research assumed that cohesive forces and molecular adhesion were involved in the fly attachment mechanism. The main elements that contribute to the overall attachment force, however, remained unknown. Multiple local force\u201a\u00c4\u00ecvolume measurements were performed on individual terminal plates by using atomic force microscopy. It was shown that the geometry of a single terminal plate had a higher border and considerably lower centre. Local adhesion was approximately twice as strong in the centre of the plate as on its border. Adhesion of fly footprints on a glass surface, recorded within 20 min after preparation, was similar to adhesion in the centre of a single attachment pad. Adhesion strongly decreased with decreasing volume of footprint fluid, indicating that the layer of pad secretion covering the terminal plates is crucial for the generation of a strong attractive force. Our data provide the first direct evidence that, in addition to Van der Waals and Coulomb forces, attractive capillary forces, mediated by pad secretion, are a critical factor in the fly's attachment mechanism.\",TRUE\nAdhesion of single bacterial cells in the micronewton range.,\"The adhesion of bacteria to surfaces plays critical roles in the environment, disease, and industry.

In G. petersii prereceptor mechanisms include properties of the animal's skin and internal tissue and the shape of the fish's body. These lead to a specific design of the signal carrier at different skin regions of the fish, preparing them to perform certain detection tasks. Prereceptor mechanisms also ensure that the moveable skin appendix of G. petersii, the 'Schnauzenorgan', receives an optimal sensory signal during all stages of its movement. Another important aspect of active sensing in G. petersii concerns the locomotor strategies during electrolocation. When foraging, the animals adopt a particular position with the body slanted forward bringing the so-called 'nasal region' in a position to examine the environment in front of and at the side of the fish. Simultaneously, the Schnauzenorgan performs rhythmic left-right searching movements. When an object of interest is encountered, the Schnauzenorgan is brought in a twitching movement towards the object and is moved over it for further exploration. The densities of electroreceptor organs is extraordinary high at the Schnauzenorgan and, to a lesser extend, at the nasal region. In these so-called foveal regions, the mormyromasts have a different morphology compared to other parts of the electroreceptive skin. Our results on mormyromast density and morphology, prereceptor mechanisms and electric images, central processing of electroreceptive information, and on behavioural strategies of G. petersii lead us to formulate the hypothesis that these fish possess two separate electric foveae, each of which is specialized for certain perceptional tasks.\",TRUE\nActive-site properties of Phrixotrix railroad worm green and red bioluminescence-eliciting luciferases,\"The luciferases of the railroad worm Phrixotrix (Coleoptera: Phengodidae) are the only beetle luciferases that naturally produce true red bioluminescence.

By retaining insects that strike the web, these spirally arrayed threads allow a spider time to locate and subdue prey. The viscous capture threads spun by modern orb-weaving spiders of the Araneoidea clade replaced the dry, fuzzy cribellar capture threads of the Deinopoidea and feature regularly spaced moist, adhesive droplets. The stickiness of a cribellar thread is limited by its tendency to peel from a surface after the adhesion generated at the edges of contact is exceeded. In this study we test the hypothesis that viscous thread overcomes this limitation by implementing a suspension bridge mechanism (SBM) that recruits the adhesion of multiple thread droplets. We do so by using contact plates of four widths to measure the stickiness of six species' viscous threads whose profiles range from small, closely spaced droplets to large, widely spaced droplets. The increased stickiness registered by an increased number of thread droplets supports the operation of a SBM. However, the accompanying decrease in mean per droplet adhesion shows that droplets interior to the edges of thread contact contribute successively less adhesion. Models developed from these data suggest that the suspension bridge mechanism is limited to a span of approximately 12 droplets.\",TRUE\nAerial roots of epiphytic orchids: the velamen radicum and its role in water and nutrient uptake,\"The velamen rad\n######################\noutput:"}}

This raises the question of why subordinates (betas) cooperate. Three nonexclusive hypotheses explain the adaptive basis of helping behavior by subordinate males: cooperation may increase (1) subordinates\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 immediate reproductive success, (2) the reproductive success of close relatives, or (3) subordinates\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 chances of future reproduction. I demonstrated that beta males rarely sired chicks and were unrelated to their alpha partners but received delayed direct benefits from cooperation; betas had an increased probability of becoming an alpha when compared to males that had not been betas. To investigate the mechanism by which betas attain these adaptive benefits, I examined betas\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 success in replacing their alpha partners both in natural turnover events and when alphas were experimentally removed. Beta males did not consistently inherit alpha roles in the same territories where they served their beta tenure, arguing that queuing for status does not fully explain the benefits of cooperation for betas. Instead, betas may be apprenticing to develop effective and appropriate displays that enhance their subsequent success as alphas. Complex social affiliations appear to mediate selective pressure for cooperation in this species.\",TRUE\nAdaptive evolution of threonine deaminase in plant defense against insect herbivores,\"Gene duplication is a major source of plant chemical diversity that mediates plant\u201a\u00c4\u00echerbivore interactions. There is little direct evidence, however, that novel chemical traits arising from gene duplication reduce herbivory. Higher plants use threonine deaminase (TD) to catalyze the dehydration of threonine (Thr) to \u0152\u00b1-ketobutyrate and ammonia as the committed step in the biosynthesis of isoleucine (Ile). Cultivated tomato and related Solanum species contain a duplicated TD paralog (TD2) that is coexpressed with a suite of genes involved in herbivore resistance. Analysis of TD2-deficient tomato lines showed that TD2 has a defensive function related to Thr catabolism in the gut of lepidopteran herbivores. During herbivory, the regulatory domain of TD2 is removed by proteolysis to generate a truncated protein (pTD2) that efficiently degrades Thr without being inhibited by Ile. We show that this proteolytic activation step occurs in the gut of lepidopteran but not coleopteran herbivores, and is catalyzed by a\n######################\noutput:"}}

The osmotic influx and efflux of water in living cells can cause a rapid movement of organs in a predetermined direction. Even dead tissue can be actuated by a swelling or drying of the plant cell walls. The deformation of the organ is controlled at different levels of tissue hierarchy by geometrical constraints at the micrometre level (e.g. cell shape and size) and cell wall polymer composition at the nanoscale (e.g. cellulose fibril orientation). This paper reviews different mechanisms of organ movement in plants and highlights recent research in the field. Particular attention is paid to systems that are activated without any metabolism.

It appears that air-breathing through the gut is involved, with the anterior portion of the digestive tract playing a central role: it became significantly more alkaline in fish exposed to air or to environmental ammonia. The skin, which also became more alkaline during air exposure, may also be involved in ammonia volatilization in air-exposed fish. This represents the first report of a fish using volatilization of NH3 as part of a defence against ammonia toxicity. It can be concluded that the main strategy adopted by M. anguillicaudatus confronted with ammonia loading or air exposure is to tolerate high ammonia levels in the tissues. During periods of elevated tissue ammonia levels, some ammonia is lost by volatilization via air-breathing using the gut. In addition, some ammonia may be lost across the skin during air exposure.\",TRUE\nAcoustics: In a fly's ear,\"Organisms often identify the source of a sound by comparing the noises that arrive at the two ears. Using some interesting tricks, a minute fly has mastered this feat as accurately as humans.\",TRUE\n\"Active electrolocation in Gnathonemus petersii: Behaviour, sensory performance, and receptor systems\",\"Weakly electric fish can serve as model systems for active sensing because they actively emit electric signals into the environment, which they also perceive with more than 2000 electroreceptor organs (mormyromasts) distributed over almost their entire skin surface. In a process called active electrolocation, animals are able to detect and analyse objects in their environment, which allows them to perceive a detailed electrical picture of their surroundings even in complete darkness. The African mormyrid fish Gnathonemus petersii can not only detect nearby objects, but in addition can perceive other properties such as their distance, their complex electrical impedance, and their three-dimensional shape. Because most of the sensory signals the fish perceive during their nightly activity period are self-produced, evolution has shaped and adapted the mechanisms for signal production, signal perception and signal analysis by the brain. Like in many other sensory systems, so-called prereceptor mechanisms exist, which passively improve the sensory signals in such a way that the signal carrier is optimized for the extraction of relevant sensory information. In G. petersii prereceptor mechanisms include properties of the animal's skin and internal tissue and the shape of the fish's body.

While a nudibranch\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s mucus has been thought to protect the animal from nematocyst discharge, an inhibition of discharge by nudibranch mucus has never been shown. The current study investigated whether mucus from the aeolid nudibranch Aeolidia papillosa would inhibit nematocyst discharge from four species of sea anemone prey. Sea anemone tentacles were contacted with mucus-coated gelatin probes, and nematocyst discharge was quantified and compared with control probes of gelatin only. Mucus from A. papillosa inhibited the discharge of nematocysts from sea anemone tentacles. This inhibition was specifically limited to the anemone species on which the nudibranch had been feeding. When the prey species was changed, the mucus changed within 2 weeks to inhibit the nematocyst discharge of the new prey species. The nudibranchs apparently produce the inhibitory mucus rather than simply becoming coated in anemone mucus during feeding. Because of the intimate association between most aeolid nudibranchs and their prey, an adaptable mucus protection could have a significant impact on the behavior, distribution, and life history of the nudibranchs.\",TRUE\n\"Adaptation to life in aeolian sand: how the sandfish lizard, Scincus scincus, prevents sand particles from entering its lungs\",\"ABSTRACT The sandfish lizard, Scincus scincus (Squamata: Scincidae), spends nearly its whole life in aeolian sand and only comes to the surface for foraging, defecating and mating. It is not yet understood how the animal can respire without sand particles entering its respiratory organs when buried under thick layers of sand. In this work, we integrated biological studies, computational calculations and physical experiments to understand this phenomenon. We present a 3D model of the upper respiratory system based on a detailed histological analysis. A 3D-printed version of this model was used in combination with characteristic ventilation patterns for computational calculations and fluid mechanics experiments. By calculating the velocity field, we identified a sharp decrease in velocity in the anterior part of the nasal cavity where mucus and cilia are present. The experiments with the 3D-printed model validate the calculations: particles, if present, were found only in the same area as suggested by the\n######################\noutput:"}}

We hypothesized that this feeding environment might promote nutrient acquisition by the branchial and epidermal epithelia. The potential for Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii, to absorb amino acids from the environment across the skin and gill was thus investigated. l-alanine and glycine were absorbed via specific transport pathways across both gill and skin surfaces, the first such documentation of direct organic nutrient acquisition in a vertebrate animal. Uptake occurred via distinct mechanisms with respect to concentration dependence, sodium dependence and effects of putative transport inhibitors across each epithelium. Significant differences in the absorbed amino acid distribution between the skin of juveniles and adults were noted. The ability to absorb dissolved organic matter across the skin and gill may be an adaptation to a scavenging lifestyle, allowing hagfish to maximize sporadic opportunities for organic nutrient acquisition. From an evolutionary perspective, hagfish represent a transitory state between the generalized nutrient absorption pathways of aquatic invertebrates and the more specialized digestive systems of aquatic vertebrates.\",TRUE\nAdaptive Advantages of Cooperative Courtship for Subordinate Male Lance\u201a\u00c4\u00eaTailed Manakins,\"Male lance\u201a\u00c4\u00eatailed manakins (Chiroxiphia lanceolata) cooperate in complex courtship displays, but the dominant (alpha) partner monopolizes mating opportunities.

The latter adaptations are constraints imposed by the overriding requirement for exceptionally fast release of the hydrolytic product MgADP. Otherwise, as in Drosophila embryonic muscle and other slow muscle types, a step associated with MgADP release limits muscle contraction speed by delaying the detachment of myosin from actin.\",TRUE\nAn excitable gene regulatory circuit induces transient cellular differentiation,\"Certain types of cellular differentiation are probabilistic and transient. In such systems individual cells can switch to an alternative state and, after some time, switch back again. In Bacillus subtilis, competence is an example of such a transiently differentiated state associated with the capability for DNA uptake from the environment. Individual genes and proteins underlying differentiation into the competent state have been identified, but it has been unclear how these genes interact dynamically in individual cells to control both spontaneous entry into competence and return to vegetative growth. Here we show that this behaviour can be understood in terms of excitability in the underlying genetic circuit. Using quantitative fluorescence time-lapse microscopy, we directly observed the activities of multiple circuit components simultaneously in individual cells, and analysed the resulting data in terms of a mathematical model. We find that an excitable core module containing positive and negative feedback loops can explain both entry into, and exit from, the competent state. We further tested this model by analysing initiation in sister cells, and by re-engineering the gene circuit to specifically block exit. Excitable dynamics driven by noise naturally generate stochastic and transient responses, thereby providing an ideal mechanism for competence regulation.\",TRUE\nAn experimental test of the contributions and condition dependence of microstructure and carotenoids in yellow plumage coloration,\"A combination of structural and pigmentary components is responsible for many of the colour displays of animals.

An anatomical interpretation of this mechanical movement was investigated.METHODSAn anatomical study of the stem was conducted on the juvenile plants raised under different water treatments and on the branch-orders of adult A. hierochuntica size-classes.KEY RESULTSIn the juvenile stem of A. hierochuntica, the area of cortex, conducting tissue and pith increased with water availability. However, the hydraulic conductance decreased, resulting in a better withdrawal of water in water-stressed plants. The anatomical investigation of the hygrochastic mechanism revealed an asymmetric distribution of the cortical tissues, with the conducting tissues of the stem of juvenile and adult plants being larger in the lower side. The hydraulic conductance was better in the basal and middle branch-orders than the terminal ones, permitting better conductance of water to the subsequent branch-orders.CONCLUSIONSThe lignified conducting tissue of the whole stem, having a hygrochastic nature, controls the movement of the branches. The greater amount of conducting tissue associated with a higher density of wide xylem vessels was observed in the lower side of the stem as compared with the upper side. Consequently, the conducting tissue in the lower side of the stem was suggested to be more effective in the opening process of the curled dry branches through better and more rapid conductance of water. Alternatively, due to the few narrow xylem vessels in the upper side of the stem, it was likely that the conducting tissue in the upper side is more effective in the closing process by providing more rapid drying. The mechanical rise of water and the related hygrochastic efficiency were maximized in the basal and middle branch-orders that are mostly involved in the mechanical movement.\",TRUE\nAnatomically diverse butterfly scales all produce structural colours by coherent scattering,\"SUMMARY The structural colours of butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) have been attributed to a diversity of physical mechanisms, including multilayer interference, diffraction, Bragg scattering, Tyndall scattering and Rayleigh scattering. We used fibre optic spectrophotometry, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and 2D Fourier analysis to investigate the physical mechanisms of structural colour production in twelve lepidopteran species from four families, representing all of the previously proposed anatomical and optical classes of butterfly nanostructure. The 2D Fourier analyses of TEMs of colour producing butterfly scales document that all species are appropriately nanostructured to produce visible colours by coherent scattering, i.e. differential interference and reinforcement of scattered, visible wavelengths.\n######################\noutput:"}}

How the ordered structure of aragonite layers is achieved has been unclear. Suzuki et al. (p. 1388, published online 13 August 2009; see the Perspective by Kr\u221a\u2202ger) identified two acidic matrix proteins (Pif 97 and Pif 80) that regulate nacre formation in the Japanese pearl oyster. The proteins appear to form a complex in which Pif 80 binds to aragonite and Pif 97 binds to other macromolecules in the organic matrix. A matrix protein is identified that regulates nacre formation in the Japanese pearl oyster. The mollusk shell is a hard tissue consisting of calcium carbonate crystals and an organic matrix. The nacre of the shell is characterized by a stacked compartment structure with a uniformly oriented c axis of aragonite crystals in each compartment. Using a calcium carbonate\u201a\u00c4\u00ecbinding assay, we identified an acidic matrix protein, Pif, in the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata that specifically binds to aragonite crystals. The Pif complementary DNA (cDNA) encoded a precursor protein, which was posttranslationally cleaved to produce Pif 97 and Pif 80. The results from immunolocalization, a knockdown experiment that used RNA interference, and in vitro calcium carbonate crystallization studies strongly indicate that Pif regulates nacre formation.\",TRUE\nAn exceptionally fast actomyosin reaction powers insect flight muscle,\"Insects, as a group, have been remarkably successful in adapting to a great range of physical and biological environments, in large part because of their ability to fly. The evolution of flight in small insects was accompanied by striking adaptations of the thoracic musculature that enabled very high wing beat frequencies. At the cellular and protein filament level, a stretch activation mechanism evolved that allowed high-oscillatory work to be achieved at very high frequencies as contraction and nerve stimulus became asynchronous. At the molecular level, critical adaptations occurred within the motor protein myosin II, because its elementary interactions with actin set the speed of sarcomere contraction. Here, we show that the key myosin enzymatic adaptations required for powering the very fast flight muscles in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster include the highest measured detachment rate of myosin from actin (forward rate constant, 3,698 s\u201a\u00e0\u00ed1), an exceptionally weak affinity of\n######################\noutput:"}}

Using presentations of 15 species of live predators, we show that acoustic features of the mobbing calls of black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapilla) vary with the size of the predator. Companion playback experiments revealed that chickadees detect this information and that the intensity of mobbing behavior is related to the size and threat of the potential predator. This study demonstrates an unsuspected level of complexity and sophistication in avian alarm calls.\",TRUE\nAlternation between attachment mechanisms by limpets in the field,\"The attachment mechanism used by limpets in the rocky, wave-swept intertidal zone of California was determined during high tide and low tide. The two mechanisms that limpets are known to use, suction and glue-like adhesion, were distinguished by measuring the limpets' attachment forces in shear and by staining for glue-like residues where the limpets had been attached. The results show that \u201a\u00e2\u00e0 73% of limpets at high tide use suction, while the rest use glue-like adhesion. Conversely, \u201a\u00e2\u00e0 75% of limpets at low tide use glue-like adhesion, while the rest use suction. The normal tenacity of limpets was also measured at high and low tide. The mean tenacity at high tide was significantly less than that at low tide. From these data it was estimated that the mean tenacity of glue-like adhesion is \u201a\u00e2\u00e0 0.23 MN\u00ac\u2211m\u201a\u00e0\u00ed2 and the mean tenacity of suction adhesion is \u201a\u00e2\u00e0 0.09 MN\u00ac\u2211m\u201a\u00e0\u00ed2.

During a tandem run, a single leader teaches one follower the route to important resources such as sources of food or better nest sites. In the present study, we investigate what tandem leaders and followers do, in the context of nest emigration, if their partner goes missing. Our experiments involved removing either leaders or followers at set points during tandem runs. Former leaders first stand still and wait for their missing follower but then most often proceed alone to the new nest site. By contrast, former followers often first engage in a Brownian search, for almost exactly the time that their former leader should have waited for them, and then former followers switch to a superdiffusive search. In this way, former followers first search their immediate neighbourhood for their lost leader before becoming ever more wide ranging so that in the absence of their former leader they can often find the new nest, re-encounter the old one or meet a new leader. We also show that followers gain useful information even from incomplete tandem runs. These observations point to the important principle that sophisticated communication behaviours may have evolved as anytime algorithms, i.e. procedures that are beneficial even if they do not run to completion.\",TRUE\nAnt semiochemicals limit apterous aphid dispersal,\"Some organisms can manipulate the nervous systems of others or alter their physiology in order to obtain benefit. Ants are known to limit alate aphid dispersal by physically removing wings and also through chemical manipulation of the alate developmental pathway. This results in reduced dispersal and higher local densities of aphids, which benefit ants in terms of increased honeydew and prey availability. Here, we show that the walking movement of mutualistic apterous aphids is also reduced by ant semiochemicals. Aphids walk slower and their dispersal from an unsuitable patch is hampered by ants. If aphid walking dispersal has evolved as a means of natural enemy escape, then ant chemicals may act as a signal indicating protection; hence, reduced dispersal could be adaptive for aphids. If, however, dispersal is\n######################\noutput:"}}

However, their structure\u201a\u00c4\u00ecactivity relationships and mechanisms of action against fungal pathogens of plants are still largely unknown. A small highly cationic peptide NCR044 with potent antifungal activity has been identified. This peptide has a unique highly dynamic structure and exhibits multifaceted mechanisms of action against a fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Exogenous application of this peptide confers resistance to a gray mold disease caused by B. cinerea in tobacco and tomato plants as well as postharvest products. Our work paves the way for future development of NCR peptides as spray-on antifungal agents. In the indeterminate nodules of a model legume Medicago truncatula, \u201a\u00e0\u00ba700 nodule-specific cysteine-rich (NCR) peptides with conserved cysteine signature are expressed. NCR peptides are highly diverse in sequence, and some of these cationic peptides exhibit antimicrobial activity in vitro and in vivo. However, there is a lack of knowledge regarding their structural architecture, antifungal activity, and modes of action against plant fungal pathogens. Here, the three-dimensional NMR structure of the 36-amino acid NCR044 peptide was solved.

They were widely reported to reduce the reflectance for normally incident light, contributing to camouflage by reducing glare to predators, while furthermore enhancing the intake of light, which is especially important for nocturnal insects. Our preliminary observations suggest a third function: in contrast to the rest of the body, ommatidia of various insects remain clean, even in a heavy contaminated environment. In order to prove such an anti-contamination hypothesis of these structures, we measured the adhesive properties of polymer moulds of insect ommatidia, and compared these data with control surfaces having the same curvature radii but lacking such a nanostructure. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) study and force measurements using an atomic force microscope (AFM) on the eye surfaces of three different insect species, dragonfly Aeshna mixta (Odonata), moth Laothoe populi (Lepidoptera) and fly Volucella pellucens (Diptera), were undertaken. We revealed that adhesion is greatly reduced by corneal grating in L. populi and V. pellucens when compared with their smooth controls. The smooth cornea of A. mixta showed no statistically significant difference to its control. We assume that this anti-adhesive phenomenon is due to a decrease in the real contact area between contaminating particles and the eye's surface. Such a combination of three functions in one nanostructure can be interesting for the development of industrial multifunctional surfaces capable of enhancing light harvesting while reducing light reflection and adhesion.\",TRUE\n\"An Acidic Matrix Protein, Pif, Is a Key Macromolecule for Nacre Formation\",\"Making Mother of Pearl Nacre is an iridescent layer of calcium carbonate lining the inside of shells of marine mollusks and is commonly known as \u201a\u00c4\u00famother of pearl.\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 It is composed of layers of uniformly oriented crystals of aragonite (a metastable form of calcium carbonate) separated by layers of organic matrix.

Despite the ubiquity of this type of coloration, neither the relative contribution of structures and pigments to variation in such colour displays nor the relative effects of extrinsic factors on the structural and pigment-based components of such colour has been determined. Understanding the sources of colour variation is important because structures and pigments may convey different information to conspecifics. In an experiment on captive American goldfinches Carduelis tristis, we manipulated two parameters, carotenoid availability and food availability, known to affect the expression of carotenoid pigments in a full-factorial design. Yellow feathers from these birds were then analysed in two ways. First, we used full-spectrum spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography to examine the extent to which variation in white structural colour and total carotenoid content was associated with variation in colour properties of feathers. The carotenoid content of yellow feathers predicted two colour parameters (principal component 1\u201a\u00c4\u00eerepresenting high values of ultraviolet and yellow chroma and low values of violet\u201a\u00c4\u00ecblue chroma\u201a\u00c4\u00eeand hue). Two different colour parameters (violet\u201a\u00c4\u00ecblue and yellow chroma) from white de-pigmented feathers, as well as carotenoid content, predicted reflectance measurements from yellow feathers. Second, we determined the relative effects of our experimental manipulations on white structural colour and yellow colour. Carotenoid availability directly affected yellow colour, while food availability affected it only in combination with carotenoid availability. None of our manipulations had significant effects on the expression of white structural colour. Our results suggest that the contribution of microstructures to variation in the expression of yellow coloration is less than the contribution of carotenoid content, and that carotenoid deposition is more dependent on extrinsic variability than is the production of white structural colour.\",TRUE\nAn insect trap as habitat: cohesion-failure mechanism prevents adhesion of Pameridea roridulae bugs to the sticky surface of the plant Roridula gorgonias,\"SUMMARY The glandular trichomes of the plant Roridula gorgonias release an extremely adhesive, visco-elastic, resinous secretion that traps a variety of insects, including those having a considerable body size.

Mapping this biological setting into the \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Ant-in-a-Labyrinth\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 framework which studies physical transport through disordered media allows us to formulate precise links between the statistics of environmental challenges and the ants\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 collective navigation abilities. We show that, in this environment, the ants use their numbers to collectively extend their sensing range. Although this extension is moderate, it nevertheless allows for extremely fast traversal times that overshadow known physical solutions to the \u201a\u00c4\u00f2Ant-in-a-Labyrinth\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 problem. To explain this large payoff, we use percolation theory and prove that whenever the labyrinth is solvable, a logarithmically small sensing range suffices for extreme speedup.

Through the use of modern microscopy and nanomechanical characterization techniques, we describe the architectural and mechanical properties of the radular teeth from Cryptochiton stelleri. Chiton teeth are shown to exhibit the largest hardness and stiffness of any biominerals reported to date, being notably as much as three-fold harder than human enamel and the calcium carbonate-based shells of mollusks.

We have sought to reveal the mechanism underlying the apparent non-sticky nature of the cuticle of this bug. In this study, we have visualized intact plant and insect surfaces using cryo-scanning electron microscopy and measured the adhesive properties of the plant secretion on different surfaces. We present a combination of structural and experimental results that suggest that a thick and cohesively weak film of an outermost, epicuticular greasy secretion acts as a `sloughing-off' layer, preventing the formation of contacts between the sticky plant secretion and the solid insect cuticle. In a comparative study of fresh cuticle fractures of flies representing a typical prey of R. gorgonias, a thin, fragmentary layer of epicuticular grease was revealed. These results indicate that, when trapping prey, the plant adhesive might form proper contact with solid islands of the insect cuticle that are free of epicuticular grease.\",TRUE\nAn Intertidal Sea Star Adjusts Thermal Inertia to Avoid Extreme Body Temperatures,\"The body temperature of ectotherms is influenced by the interaction of abiotic conditions, morphology, and behavior.

By retaining insects that strike the web, these spirally arrayed threads allow a spider time to locate and subdue prey. The viscous capture threads spun by modern orb-weaving spiders of the Araneoidea clade replaced the dry, fuzzy cribellar capture threads of the Deinopoidea and feature regularly spaced moist, adhesive droplets. The stickiness of a cribellar thread is limited by its tendency to peel from a surface after the adhesion generated at the edges of contact is exceeded. In this study we test the hypothesis that viscous thread overcomes this limitation by implementing a suspension bridge mechanism (SBM) that recruits the adhesion of multiple thread droplets. We do so by using contact plates of four widths to measure the stickiness of six species' viscous threads whose profiles range from small, closely spaced droplets to large, widely spaced droplets. The increased stickiness registered by an increased number of thread droplets supports the operation of a SBM. However, the accompanying decrease in mean per droplet adhesion shows that droplets interior to the edges of thread contact contribute successively less adhesion.

In aquatic environments, Caulobacter crescentus is one of the first colonizers of submerged surfaces. Using a micromanipulation technique, we measured the adhesion force of single C. crescentus cells attached to borosilicate substrates through their adhesive holdfast. The detachment forces measured for 14 cells ranged over 0.11 to 2.26 microN, averaging 0.59 +/- 0.62 microN. Based on the calculation of stress distribution with the finite element analysis method (dividing an object into small grids and calculating relevant parameters for all of the elements), the adhesion strength between the holdfast and the substrate is >68 N/mm(2) in the central region of contact.

By retaining insects that strike the web, these spirally arrayed threads allow a spider time to locate and subdue prey. The viscous capture threads spun by modern orb-weaving spiders of the Araneoidea clade replaced the dry, fuzzy cribellar capture threads of the Deinopoidea and feature regularly spaced moist, adhesive droplets. The stickiness of a cribellar thread is limited by its tendency to peel from a surface after the adhesion generated at the edges of contact is exceeded. In this study we test the hypothesis that viscous thread overcomes this limitation by implementing a suspension bridge mechanism (SBM) that recruits the adhesion of multiple thread droplets. We do so by using contact plates of four widths to measure the stickiness of six species' viscous threads whose profiles range from small, closely spaced droplets to large, widely spaced droplets. The increased stickiness registered by an increased number of thread droplets supports the operation of a SBM. However, the accompanying decrease in mean per droplet adhesion shows that droplets interior to the edges of thread contact contribute successively less adhesion. Models developed from these data suggest that the suspension bridge mechanism is limited to a span of approximately 12 droplets.\",TRUE\nAerial roots of epiphytic orchids: the velamen radicum and its role in water and nutrient uptake,\"The velamen rad"}}

This makes the lipid layers more ordered and creates a tighter barrier against water vapor diffusion, reducing water loss.\n\n2. **Mountain Pine Beetle Flight and Host Colonization**\n   - Female mountain pine beetles that fly longer distances and lose more body mass during flight are less likely to colonize new hosts (trees) but produce more aggregation pheromone.\n   - Male beetles' production of attraction pheromone is affected by their condition after flying, not the energy used during flight.\n   - This variation in flight behavior helps maintain population levels by balancing safe and risky host colonization strategies.\n\n3. **Piezoelectric Scaffold for Adaptive Bone Tissue Engineering**\n   - A new material system is developed that can adapt its mechanical properties in response to external stress.\n   - Piezoelectric scaffolds generate charges when stressed, which induce mineralization from surrounding media, reinforcing regions of high stress or damaged areas.\n   - This self-regenerating material could help address challenges in load-bearing applications by adapting to changing stress conditions.\n\n4. **Daily Variation of UV-Protective Compounds in Marine Dinoflagellate**\n   - The marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae increases its production of UV-absorbing compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids) when exposed to high photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) or PAR plus ultraviolet radiation (UVR).\n   - These compounds help protect the dinoflagellate from UV damage.\n\n5. **Termite Mounds as Passive Ventilation Systems**\n   - Termite mounds in different environments use periodic solar heating to drive internal ventilation, functioning like an external lung for the colony.\n   - Despite differences in gas stratification and overturning patterns, termite architectures can harness solar energy to facilitate gas exchange, with implications for human engineering. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

In G. petersii prereceptor mechanisms include properties of the animal's skin and internal tissue and the shape of the fish's body. These lead to a specific design of the signal carrier at different skin regions of the fish, preparing them to perform certain detection tasks. Prereceptor mechanisms also ensure that the moveable skin appendix of G. petersii, the 'Schnauzenorgan', receives an optimal sensory signal during all stages of its movement. Another important aspect of active sensing in G. petersii concerns the locomotor strategies during electrolocation. When foraging, the animals adopt a particular position with the body slanted forward bringing the so-called 'nasal region' in a position to examine the environment in front of and at the side of the fish. Simultaneously, the Schnauzenorgan performs rhythmic left-right searching movements. When an object of interest is encountered, the Schnauzenorgan is brought in a twitching movement towards the object and is moved over it for further exploration. The densities of electroreceptor organs is extraordinary high at the Schnauzenorgan and, to a lesser extend, at the nasal region. In these so-called foveal regions, the mormyromasts have a different morphology compared to other parts of the electroreceptive skin. Our results on mormyromast density and morphology, prereceptor mechanisms and electric images, central processing of electroreceptive information, and on behavioural strategies of G. petersii lead us to formulate the hypothesis that these fish possess two separate electric foveae, each of which is specialized for certain perceptional tasks.\",TRUE\nActive-site properties of Phrixotrix railroad worm green and red bioluminescence-eliciting luciferases,\"The luciferases of the railroad worm Phrixotrix (Coleoptera: Phengodidae) are the only beetle luciferases that naturally produce true red bioluminescence.

We hypothesized that this feeding environment might promote nutrient acquisition by the branchial and epidermal epithelia. The potential for Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii, to absorb amino acids from the environment across the skin and gill was thus investigated. l-alanine and glycine were absorbed via specific transport pathways across both gill and skin surfaces, the first such documentation of direct organic nutrient acquisition in a vertebrate animal. Uptake occurred via distinct mechanisms with respect to concentration dependence, sodium dependence and effects of putative transport inhibitors across each epithelium. Significant differences in the absorbed amino acid distribution between the skin of juveniles and adults were noted. The ability to absorb dissolved organic matter across the skin and gill may be an adaptation to a scavenging lifestyle, allowing hagfish to maximize sporadic opportunities for organic nutrient acquisition. From an evolutionary perspective, hagfish represent a transitory state between the generalized nutrient absorption pathways of aquatic invertebrates and the more specialized digestive systems of aquatic vertebrates.\",TRUE\nAdaptive Advantages of Cooperative Courtship for Subordinate Male Lance\u201a\u00c4\u00eaTailed Manakins,\"Male lance\u201a\u00c4\u00eatailed manakins (Chiroxiphia lanceolata) cooperate in complex courtship displays, but the dominant (alpha) partner monopolizes mating opportunities.

We hypothesized that this feeding environment might promote nutrient acquisition by the branchial and epidermal epithelia. The potential for Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii, to absorb amino acids from the environment across the skin and gill was thus investigated. l-alanine and glycine were absorbed via specific transport pathways across both gill and skin surfaces, the first such documentation of direct organic nutrient acquisition in a vertebrate animal. Uptake occurred via distinct mechanisms with respect to concentration dependence, sodium dependence and effects of putative transport inhibitors across each epithelium. Significant differences in the absorbed amino acid distribution between the skin of juveniles and adults were noted. The ability to absorb dissolved organic matter across the skin and gill may be an adaptation to a scavenging lifestyle, allowing hagfish to maximize sporadic opportunities for organic nutrient acquisition. From an evolutionary perspective, hagfish represent a transitory state between the generalized nutrient absorption pathways of aquatic invertebrates and the more specialized digestive systems of aquatic vertebrates.\",TRUE\nAdaptive Advantages of Cooperative Courtship for Subordinate Male Lance\u201a\u00c4\u00eaTailed Manakins,\"Male lance\u201a\u00c4\u00eatailed manakins (Chiroxiphia lanceolata) cooperate in complex courtship displays, but the dominant (alpha) partner monopolizes mating opportunities.

This makes the lipid layers more ordered and creates a tighter barrier against water vapor diffusion, reducing water loss.\n\n2. **Mountain Pine Beetle Flight and Host Colonization**\n   - Female mountain pine beetles that fly longer distances and lose more body mass during flight are less likely to colonize new hosts (trees) but produce more aggregation pheromone.\n   - Male beetles' production of attraction pheromone is affected by their condition after flying, not the energy used during flight.\n   - This variation in flight behavior helps maintain population levels by balancing safe and risky host colonization strategies.\n\n3. **Piezoelectric Scaffold for Adaptive Bone Tissue Engineering**\n   - A new material system is developed that can adapt its mechanical properties in response to external stress.\n   - Piezoelectric scaffolds generate charges when stressed, which induce mineralization from surrounding media, reinforcing regions of high stress or damaged areas.\n   - This self-regenerating material could help address challenges in load-bearing applications by adapting to changing stress conditions.\n\n4. **Daily Variation of UV-Protective Compounds in Marine Dinoflagellate**\n   - The marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae increases its production of UV-absorbing compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids) when exposed to high photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) or PAR plus ultraviolet radiation (UVR).\n   - These compounds help protect the dinoflagellate from UV damage.\n\n5. **Termite Mounds as Passive Ventilation Systems**\n   - Termite mounds in different environments use periodic solar heating to drive internal ventilation, functioning like an external lung for the colony.\n   - Despite differences in gas stratification and overturning patterns, termite architectures can harness solar energy to facilitate gas exchange, with implications for human engineering. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

Yet, quantitative evidence for the alleged functions, e.g., efficient water and nutrient uptake, nutrient retention, reduction of water loss, mechanical protection, or the avoidance of overheating, is rare or missing. We tested the notion originally put forward by Went in 1940 that the velamen allows plants to capture and immobilize the first solutions arriving in a rainfall, which are the most heavily charged with nutrients. In a series of experiments, we examined whether all necessary functional characteristics are given for this scenario to be realistic under ecological conditions. First, we show that the velamen of a large number of orchid species takes up solutions within seconds, while evaporation from the velamen takes several hours. Charged ions are retained in the velamen probably due to positive and negative charges in the cell walls, while uncharged compounds are lost to the external medium. Finally, we demonstrate that nutrient uptake follows biphasic kinetics with a highly efficient, active transport system at low external concentrations. Thus, our results lend strong support to Went\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s hypothesis: the velamen fulfills an important function in nutrient uptake in the epiphytic habitat.

Using scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy, mathematical modeling, and the saccate pollen of three extant conifers with structurally different pollen grains (Pinus, Falcatifolium, Dacrydium), we developed a computational model to investigate pollen flight. The model calculates terminal settling velocity based on structural characters of the pollen grain, including lengths, widths, and depths of the main body and sacci; angle of saccus rotation; and thicknesses of the saccus wall, endoreticulations, intine, and exine. The settling speeds predicted by the model were empirically validated by stroboscopic photography. This study is the first to quantitatively demonstrate the adaptive significance of sacci for the aerodynamics of wind pollination. Modeling pollen both with and without sacci indicated that sacci can reduce pollen settling speeds, thereby increasing dispersal distance, with the exception of pollen grains having robust endoreticulations and those with thick saccus walls. Furthermore, because the mathematical model is based on structural characters and error propagation methods show that the model yields valid results when sample sizes are small, the flight dynamics of fossil pollen can be investigated.

Finally, I compared these results to those of my earlier study on the similarly sized and distantly related southern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans). The sugar gliders in this study accelerated downward slightly (1.0\u00ac\u00b10.5 m s\u201a\u00c4\u00ec2), and also accelerated forward (2.1\u00ac\u00b10.6 m s\u201a\u00c4\u00ec2) in all but one trial, indicating that the body weight was not fully supported by aerodynamic forces and that some of the lift produced forward acceleration rather than just balancing body weight.

Movements of the limbs were strongly correlated with body rotations, suggesting that sugar gliders make extensive use of limb movements to control their orientation during gliding flight. In addition, among individuals, different limb movements were associated with a given body rotation, suggesting that individual variation exists in the control of body rotations.

From the whole body accelerations I estimated the aerodynamic forces generated by the animals. I computed the correlations between movements of the limbs and body rotations to examine the control of orientation during flight. Finally, I compared these results to those of my earlier study on the similarly sized and distantly related southern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans). The sugar gliders in this study accelerated downward slightly (1.0\u00ac\u00b10.5 m s\u201a\u00c4\u00ec2), and also accelerated forward (2.1\u00ac\u00b10.6 m s\u201a\u00c4\u00ec2) in all but one trial, indicating that the body weight was not fully supported by aerodynamic forces and that some of the lift produced forward acceleration rather than just balancing body weight. The gliders used high angles of attack (44.15\u00ac\u00b13.12\u00ac\u221e), far higher than the angles at which airplane wings would stall, yet generated higher lift coefficients (1.48\u00ac\u00b10.18) than would be expected for a stalled wing. Movements of the limbs were strongly correlated with body rotations, suggesting that sugar gliders make extensive use of limb movements to control their orientation during gliding flight. In addition, among individuals, different limb movements were associated with a given body rotation, suggesting that individual variation exists in the control of body rotations. Under similar conditions, flying squirrels generated higher lift coefficients and lower drag coefficients than sugar gliders, yet had only marginally shallower glides. Flying squirrels have a number of morphological specializations not shared by sugar gliders that may help to explain their greater lift generating performance.\",TRUE\n\"Aerodynamic force generation, performance and control of body orientation during gliding in sugar gliders (Petaurus breviceps)\",\"SUMMARY Gliding has often been discussed in the literature as a possible precursor to powered flight in vertebrates, but few studies exist on the mechanics of gliding in living animals.

This makes the lipid layers more ordered and creates a tighter barrier against water vapor diffusion, reducing water loss.\n\n2. **Mountain Pine Beetle Flight and Host Colonization**\n   - Female mountain pine beetles that fly longer distances and lose more body mass during flight are less likely to colonize new hosts (trees) but produce more aggregation pheromone.\n   - Male beetles' production of attraction pheromone is affected by their condition after flying, not the energy used during flight.\n   - This variation in flight behavior helps maintain population levels by balancing safe and risky host colonization strategies.\n\n3. **Piezoelectric Scaffold for Adaptive Bone Tissue Engineering**\n   - A new material system is developed that can adapt its mechanical properties in response to external stress.\n   - Piezoelectric scaffolds generate charges when stressed, which induce mineralization from surrounding media, reinforcing regions of high stress or damaged areas.\n   - This self-regenerating material could help address challenges in load-bearing applications by adapting to changing stress conditions.\n\n4. **Daily Variation of UV-Protective Compounds in Marine Dinoflagellate**\n   - The marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae increases its production of UV-absorbing compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids) when exposed to high photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) or PAR plus ultraviolet radiation (UVR).\n   - These compounds help protect the dinoflagellate from UV damage.\n\n5. **Termite Mounds as Passive Ventilation Systems**\n   - Termite mounds in different environments use periodic solar heating to drive internal ventilation, functioning like an external lung for the colony.\n   - Despite differences in gas stratification and overturning patterns, termite architectures can harness solar energy to facilitate gas exchange, with implications for human engineering. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

The current study investigated whether mucus from the aeolid nudibranch Aeolidia papillosa would inhibit nematocyst discharge from four species of sea anemone prey. Sea anemone tentacles were contacted with mucus-coated gelatin probes, and nematocyst discharge was quantified and compared with control probes of gelatin only. Mucus from A. papillosa inhibited the discharge of nematocysts from sea anemone tentacles. This inhibition was specifically limited to the anemone species on which the nudibranch had been feeding. When the prey species was changed, the mucus changed within 2 weeks to inhibit the nematocyst discharge of the new prey species. The nudibranchs apparently produce the inhibitory mucus rather than simply becoming coated in anemone mucus during feeding. Because of the intimate association between most aeolid nudibranchs and their prey, an adaptable mucus protection could have a significant impact on the behavior, distribution, and life history of the nudibranchs.\",TRUE\n\"Adaptation to life in aeolian sand: how the sandfish lizard, Scincus scincus, prevents sand particles from entering its lungs\",\"ABSTRACT The sandfish lizard, Scincus scincus (Squamata: Scincidae), spends nearly its whole life in aeolian sand and only comes to the surface for foraging, defecating and mating.

Otherwise, as in Drosophila embryonic muscle and other slow muscle types, a step associated with MgADP release limits muscle contraction speed by delaying the detachment of myosin from actin.\",TRUE\nAn excitable gene regulatory circuit induces transient cellular differentiation,\"Certain types of cellular differentiation are probabilistic and transient. In such systems individual cells can switch to an alternative state and, after some time, switch back again. In Bacillus subtilis, competence is an example of such a transiently differentiated state associated with the capability for DNA uptake from the environment. Individual genes and proteins underlying differentiation into the competent state have been identified, but it has been unclear how these genes interact dynamically in individual cells to control both spontaneous entry into competence and return to vegetative growth. Here we show that this behaviour can be understood in terms of excitability in the underlying genetic circuit. Using quantitative fluorescence time-lapse microscopy, we directly observed the activities of multiple circuit components simultaneously in individual cells, and analysed the resulting data in terms of a mathematical model. We find that an excitable core module containing positive and negative feedback loops can explain both entry into, and exit from, the competent state. We further tested this model by analysing initiation in sister cells, and by re-engineering the gene circuit to specifically block exit. Excitable dynamics driven by noise naturally generate stochastic and transient responses, thereby providing an ideal mechanism for competence regulation.\",TRUE\nAn experimental test of the contributions and condition dependence of microstructure and carotenoids in yellow plumage coloration,\"A combination of structural and pigmentary components is responsible for many of the colour displays of animals.

The latter adaptations are constraints imposed by the overriding requirement for exceptionally fast release of the hydrolytic product MgADP. Otherwise, as in Drosophila embryonic muscle and other slow muscle types, a step associated with MgADP release limits muscle contraction speed by delaying the detachment of myosin from actin.\",TRUE\nAn excitable gene regulatory circuit induces transient cellular differentiation,\"Certain types of cellular differentiation are probabilistic and transient. In such systems individual cells can switch to an alternative state and, after some time, switch back again. In Bacillus subtilis, competence is an example of such a transiently differentiated state associated with the capability for DNA uptake from the environment. Individual genes and proteins underlying differentiation into the competent state have been identified, but it has been unclear how these genes interact dynamically in individual cells to control both spontaneous entry into competence and return to vegetative growth. Here we show that this behaviour can be understood in terms of excitability in the underlying genetic circuit. Using quantitative fluorescence time-lapse microscopy, we directly observed the activities of multiple circuit components simultaneously in individual cells, and analysed the resulting data in terms of a mathematical model. We find that an excitable core module containing positive and negative feedback loops can explain both entry into, and exit from, the competent state. We further tested this model by analysing initiation in sister cells, and by re-engineering the gene circuit to specifically block exit. Excitable dynamics driven by noise naturally generate stochastic and transient responses, thereby providing an ideal mechanism for competence regulation.\",TRUE\nAn experimental test of the contributions and condition dependence of microstructure and carotenoids in yellow plumage coloration,\"A combination of structural and pigmentary components is responsible for many of the colour displays of animals.

This makes the lipid layers more ordered and creates a tighter barrier against water vapor diffusion, reducing water loss.\n\n2. **Mountain Pine Beetle Flight and Host Colonization**\n   - Female mountain pine beetles that fly longer distances and lose more body mass during flight are less likely to colonize new hosts (trees) but produce more aggregation pheromone.\n   - Male beetles' production of attraction pheromone is affected by their condition after flying, not the energy used during flight.\n   - This variation in flight behavior helps maintain population levels by balancing safe and risky host colonization strategies.\n\n3. **Piezoelectric Scaffold for Adaptive Bone Tissue Engineering**\n   - A new material system is developed that can adapt its mechanical properties in response to external stress.\n   - Piezoelectric scaffolds generate charges when stressed, which induce mineralization from surrounding media, reinforcing regions of high stress or damaged areas.\n   - This self-regenerating material could help address challenges in load-bearing applications by adapting to changing stress conditions.\n\n4. **Daily Variation of UV-Protective Compounds in Marine Dinoflagellate**\n   - The marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae increases its production of UV-absorbing compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids) when exposed to high photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) or PAR plus ultraviolet radiation (UVR).\n   - These compounds help protect the dinoflagellate from UV damage.\n\n5. **Termite Mounds as Passive Ventilation Systems**\n   - Termite mounds in different environments use periodic solar heating to drive internal ventilation, functioning like an external lung for the colony.\n   - Despite differences in gas stratification and overturning patterns, termite architectures can harness solar energy to facilitate gas exchange, with implications for human engineering. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

Return output in Here's a simplified summary of each text in plain language:\n\n1. **Bird Skin Lipids Adaptation to Desert Environments**\n   - Larks living in hot, dry deserts have less water loss from their skin compared to those in more humid environments.\n   - Instead of having more lipids in their skin (stratum corneum), desert larks have a higher proportion of certain ceramides and fewer free fatty acids. This makes the lipid layers more ordered and creates a tighter barrier against water vapor diffusion, reducing water loss.\n\n2. **Mountain Pine Beetle Flight and Host Colonization**\n   - Female mountain pine beetles that fly longer distances and lose more body mass during flight are less likely to colonize new hosts (trees) but produce more aggregation pheromone.\n   - Male beetles' production of attraction pheromone is affected by their condition after flying, not the energy used during flight.\n   - This variation in flight behavior helps maintain population levels by balancing safe and risky host colonization strategies.\n\n3. **Piezoelectric Scaffold for Adaptive Bone Tissue Engineering**\n   - A new material system is developed that can adapt its mechanical properties in response to external stress.\n   - Piezoelectric scaffolds generate charges when stressed, which induce mineralization from surrounding media, reinforcing regions of high stress or damaged areas.\n   - This self-regenerating material could help address challenges in load-bearing applications by adapting to changing stress conditions.\n\n4. **Daily Variation of UV-Protective Compounds in Marine Dinoflagellate**\n   - The marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae increases its production of UV-absorbing compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids) when exposed to high photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) or PAR plus ultraviolet radiation (UVR).\n   - These compounds help protect the dinoflagellate from UV damage.\n\n5. **Termite Mounds as Passive Ventilation Systems**\n   - Termite mounds in different environments use periodic solar heating to drive internal ventilation, functioning like an external lung for the colony.\n   - Despite differences in gas stratification and overturning patterns, termite architectures can harness solar energy to facilitate gas exchange, with implications for human engineering. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

This raises the question of why subordinates (betas) cooperate. Three nonexclusive hypotheses explain the adaptive basis of helping behavior by subordinate males: cooperation may increase (1) subordinates\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 immediate reproductive success, (2) the reproductive success of close relatives, or (3) subordinates\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 chances of future reproduction. I demonstrated that beta males rarely sired chicks and were unrelated to their alpha partners but received delayed direct benefits from cooperation; betas had an increased probability of becoming an alpha when compared to males that had not been betas. To investigate the mechanism by which betas attain these adaptive benefits, I examined betas\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 success in replacing their alpha partners both in natural turnover events and when alphas were experimentally removed. Beta males did not consistently inherit alpha roles in the same territories where they served their beta tenure, arguing that queuing for status does not fully explain the benefits of cooperation for betas. Instead, betas may be apprenticing to develop effective and appropriate displays that enhance their subsequent success as alphas. Complex social affiliations appear to mediate selective pressure for cooperation in this species.\",TRUE\nAdaptive evolution of threonine deaminase in plant defense against insect herbivores,\"Gene duplication is a major source of plant chemical diversity that mediates plant\u201a\u00c4\u00echerbivore interactions. There is little direct evidence, however, that novel chemical traits arising from gene duplication reduce herbivory. Higher plants use threonine deaminase (TD) to catalyze the dehydration of threonine (Thr) to \u0152\u00b1-ketobutyrate and ammonia as the committed step in the biosynthesis of isoleucine (Ile). Cultivated tomato and related Solanum species contain a duplicated TD paralog (TD2) that is coexpressed with a suite of genes involved in herbivore resistance. Analysis of TD2-deficient tomato lines showed that TD2 has a defensive function related to Thr catabolism in the gut of lepidopteran herbivores. During herbivory, the regulatory domain of TD2 is removed by proteolysis to generate a truncated protein (pTD2) that efficiently degrades Thr without being inhibited by Ile. We show that this proteolytic activation step occurs in the gut of lepidopteran but not coleopteran herbivores, and is catalyzed by a\n######################\noutput:"}}

Here, the three-dimensional NMR structure of the 36-amino acid NCR044 peptide was solved. This unique structure was largely disordered and highly dynamic with one four-residue \u0152\u00b1-helix and one three-residue antiparallel \u0152\u2264-sheet stabilized by two disulfide bonds. NCR044 peptide also exhibited potent fungicidal activity against multiple plant fungal pathogens, including Botrytis cinerea and three Fusarium spp. It inhibited germination in quiescent spores of B. cinerea. In germlings, it breached the fungal plasma membrane and induced reactive oxygen species. It bound to multiple bioactive phosphoinositides in vitro. Time-lapse confocal and superresolution microscopy revealed strong fungal cell wall binding, penetration of the cell membrane at discrete foci, followed by gradual loss of turgor, subsequent accumulation in the cytoplasm, and elevated levels in nucleoli of germlings. Spray-applied NCR044 significantly reduced gray mold disease symptoms caused by the fungal pathogen B. cinerea in tomato and tobacco plants, and postharvest products. Our work illustrates the antifungal activity of a structurally unique NCR peptide against plant fungal pathogens and paves the way for future development of this class of peptides as a spray-on fungistat/fungicide.\",TRUE\n\"Antimicrobial secretions and social immunity in larval burying beetles, Nicrophorus vespilloides\",\"Offspring of many animals develop in environments in which they are exposed to high densities of potentially harmful bacteria. For example, larvae of the carrion beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides face significant challenges from the bacteria they encounter during their development on decomposing vertebrate carcasses. We tested the idea that larvae secrete antimicrobial compounds during development to defend themselves against microbial exposure. We first showed that larval secretion of active antimicrobials peaked during the early stages of development. As has been found previously for parental secretions, larval secretions were active against Gram-positive but not Gram-negative bacteria, indicating that they might be based on lysozyme-like compounds. Finally, consistent with this antibacterial activity, we showed that larval survival declined significantly when challenged with lysozyme-resistant Staphylococcus aureus but not when challenged with a lysozyme-susceptible strain of the same species.

They are promising enzymes for the application of biosensing probes. Biosensing of various compounds is possible when P 450s are immobilized on oxygen electrode or on ion-sensitive field effect transistor (ISFET). Competition assay with other substrate is another biosensing method based on the biochemical assay. Optical biosensor based on a resonance mirror was also reported. Genes in the upstream region of P 450 gene including the promoter is utilized to construct reporter gene system (RGS). The system responds to a trace amount of endocrine-disrupting substance to induce luciferase.

This paper reviews the mechanisms arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi employ to enhance the salt tolerance of host plants such as enhanced nutrient acquisition (P, N, Mg and Ca), maintenance of the K(+) : Na(+) ratio, biochemical changes (accumulation of proline, betaines, polyamines, carbohydrates and antioxidants), physiological changes (photosynthetic efficiency, relative permeability, water status, abscissic acid accumulation, nodulation and nitrogen fixation), molecular changes (the expression of genes: PIP, Na(+)/H(+) antiporters, Lsnced, Lslea and LsP5CS) and ultra-structural changes. Theis review identifies certain lesser explored areas such as molecular and ultra-structural changes where further research is needed for better understanding of symbiosis with reference to salt stress for optimum usage of this technology in the field on a large scale. This review paper gives useful benchmark information for the development and prioritization of future research programmes.\",TRUE\nArbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis modulates antioxidant response in salt-stressed Trigonella foenum-graecum plants,\"An experiment was conducted to evaluate the influence of Glomus intraradices colonization on the activity of antioxidant enzymes [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (PX), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and glutathione reductase (GR)] and the accumulation of nonenzymatic antioxidants (ascorbic acid, \u0152\u00b1-tocopherol, glutathione, and carotenoids) in roots and leaves of fenugreek plants subjected to varying degrees of salinity (0, 50, 100, and 200\u00ac\u2020mM NaCl) at two time intervals (1 and 14\u00ac\u2020days after saline treatment, DAT). The antioxidative capacity was correlated with oxidative damage in the same tissue. Under salt stress, lipid peroxidation and H2O2 concentration increased with increasing severity and duration of salt stress (DoS). However, the extent of oxidative damage in mycorrhizal plants was less compared to nonmycorrhizal plants. The study reveals that mycorrhiza-mediated attenuation of oxidative stress in fenugreek plants is due to enhanced activity of antioxidant enzymes and higher concentrations of antioxidant molecules.

Nevertheless, even on fouled surfaces the adhesive forces are approximately 150 times the body weight of the fish. To identify the upper threshold of surface roughness the fish can cling to, we tested seven unfouled substrates of increasing surface roughness. The threshold roughness at which northern clingfish failed increased with specimen size. We hypothesize that because of the elastic properties of the disc margin, a larger disc can adapt to larger surface irregularities.

However, the quantitative measurements of pollen adhesion on biological surfaces have been poorly studied so far.

The results indicated distinct adhesive properties of them\u201a\u00c4\u00eethe pollen adhesion on stigmatic surfaces drastically increased over prolonged contact time, while the pollen adhesion increase on stylar surfaces was rather restrained. Based on the observation with cryo-scanning electron microscopy, we explained the experimental results by the presence of morphological features in form of flexible stigmatic papillae that may play a crucial role in enhancing both capillary attraction and van der Waals forces. The distinct adhesive properties seemingly originate from the unique adhesive tasks that each of the floral parts requires to achieve successful pollination. The insights into the adhesive interaction between pollen and the floral parts, obtained in the present study, may lead to better understanding of pollination mechanisms, which are strongly related to our food production. Additionally, the novel pollen adhesive mechanisms learned from the stigma of the studied Asteraceae plant can inspire biomimetic designs of spontaneous gripping systems.\",TRUE\nAttractive and defensive functions of the ultraviolet pigments of a flower (Hypericum calycinum),\"The flower of Hypericum calycinum, which appears uniformly yellow to humans, bears a UV pattern, presumably visible to insects.

Cellulose fibers are formed from close-packed single chains of cellulose that have been proposed to be formed by multimeric complexes (18 or more subunits) of the enzyme cellulose synthase, which exists in several isoforms. Purushotham et al. determined a cryo\u201a\u00c4\u00ecelectron microscopy structure of a trimer of a single isoform of cellulose synthase. A large channel forms a path for cellulose chains through the membrane-embedded complex. The structure also reveals oligomeric interfaces and provides a framework for modeling the larger complexes seen in plant membranes. The close arrangement of exit sites for nascent glycan chains is consistent with the enzyme complex playing a role in directing cellulose microfibril formation. Science, this issue p. 1089 The structure of a homotrimeric cellulose synthase complex provides molecular insights into cellulose fibril formation. Cellulose is an essential plant cell wall component and represents the most abundant biopolymer on Earth. Supramolecular plant cellulose synthase complexes organize multiple linear glucose polymers into microfibrils as load-bearing wall components. We determined the structure of a poplar cellulose synthase CesA homotrimer that suggests a molecular basis for cellulose microfibril formation. This complex, stabilized by cytosolic plant-conserved regions and helical exchange within the transmembrane segments, forms three channels occupied by nascent cellulose polymers. Secretion steers the polymers toward a common exit point, which could facilitate protofibril formation. CesA\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s N-terminal domains assemble into a cytosolic stalk that interacts with a microtubule-tethering protein and may thus be involved in CesA localization.

The phytotoxicity of m-tyrosine was not influenced significantly by soil N amendment; however, when significant amounts of activated carbon were added to the soil medium, growth inhibition in treated lettuce seedlings was strongly reduced. Soil texture did not influence the bioavailability or activity of m-tyrosine, as activity in high organic growth media was similar to that of sand and soil mixtures. Similar to other purported allelochemicals, soil persistence of m-tyrosine was limited, with a predicted half life of less than 1\u00ac\u2020day in soil in a controlled laboratory setting. Rapid degradation of this molecule likely was due to microbial activity but degradation did not appear to be influenced significantly by soil N amendment.

Bacteria, algae and invertebrates grow on these surfaces (fouling) and change the surface properties of the primary substrate, and therefore the attachment conditions for benthic organisms. In this study, we investigate the influence of fouling and surface roughness on the adhesive strength of northern clingfish, Gobiesox maeandricus. We measured clingfish tenacity on unfouled and fouled substrates over four surface roughnesses. We exposed surfaces for 6 weeks in the Pacific Ocean, until they were covered with periphyton. Clingfish tenacity is equivalent on both fouled and unfouled smooth substrates; however, tenacity on fouled rough surfaces is less compared with tenacity on unfouled ones. We hypothesize that parts of biofilm may act as a lubricant and decrease friction of the disc margin, thereby making disc margins slip inwards and fail at lower tenacities. Nevertheless, even on fouled surfaces the adhesive forces are approximately 150 times the body weight of the fish. To identify the upper threshold of surface roughness the fish can cling\n######################\noutput:"}}

Here, we separately evaluated the effects of case, trichomes and attic on each of several behavioural stages of predator attack using N. platani and N. bimaculatus larvae and pupae. Three generalist predators (crickets, soldier bugs and lynx spiders) that represent different feeding strategies were used in our individual-level repeated observation behavioural trials. Results strongly demonstrated that the faecal case itself greatly reduced predation risk for all combinations of beetle species, life history stage and predator. Additional evidence indicated that both trichomes and attics further and independently reduced predation risk. Variation in results among treatments was also informative. For example, the capacity of faecal case components to reduce predation sometimes varied markedly among predators and between larval versus pupal life stages. Patterns of predator behaviour provided no evidence that caseless larvae have alternative means of defence.

However, the extent of oxidative damage in mycorrhizal plants was less compared to nonmycorrhizal plants. The study reveals that mycorrhiza-mediated attenuation of oxidative stress in fenugreek plants is due to enhanced activity of antioxidant enzymes and higher concentrations of antioxidant molecules. However, the significant effect of G. intraradices colonization on individual antioxidant molecules and enzymes varied with plant tissue, salinity level, and DoS. The significant effect of G. intraradices colonization on antioxidative enzymes was more evident at 1DAT in both leaves and roots, while the concentrations of antioxidant molecules were significantly influenced at 14DAT. It is proposed that AM symbiosis can improve antioxidative defense systems of plants through higher SOD activity in M plants, facilitating rapid dismutation of O2- to H2O2, and subsequent prevention of H2O2 build-up by higher activities of CAT, APX, and PX. The potential of G. intraradices to ameliorate oxidative stress generated in fenugreek plants by salinity was more evident at higher intensities of salt stress.\",TRUE\nArchitecture and material properties of diatom shells provide effective mechanical protection,\"Diatoms are the major contributors to phytoplankton blooms in lakes and in the sea and hence are central in aquatic ecosystems and the global carbon cycle.

We explored the defence potential of the frustules as armour against predators by measuring their strength. Real and virtual loading tests (using calibrated glass microneedles and finite element analysis) were performed on centric and pennate diatom cells. Here we show that the frustules are remarkably strong by virtue of their architecture and the material properties of the diatom silica. We conclude that diatom frustules have evolved as mechanical protection for the cells because exceptional force is required to break them. The evolutionary arms race between diatoms and their specialized predators will have had considerable influence in structuring pelagic food webs and biogeochemical cycles.\",TRUE\nArchitecture of a catalytically active homotrimeric plant cellulose synthase complex,\"Plant cell wall construction crew Plants produce a complex cell wall in which cellulose\n######################\noutput:"}}

To investigate this system, unique among vertebrates, we cyclically bent isolated segments of 10 vertebrae and nine joints. For the first time in the biomechanics of fish vertebral columns, we simultaneously characterized non-linear elasticity and viscosity throughout the bending oscillation, extending recently proposed techniques for large-amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) characterization to large-amplitude oscillatory bending (LAOB). The vertebral column segments behave as non-linear viscoelastic springs. Elastic properties dominate for all frequencies and curvatures tested, increasing as either variable increases. Non-linearities within a bending cycle are most in evidence at the highest frequency, 2.0\u201a\u00c4\u00d6Hz, and curvature, 5\u201a\u00c4\u00d6m\u201a\u00e0\u00ed1. Viscous bending properties are greatest at low frequencies and high curvatures, with non-linear effects occurring at all frequencies and curvatures. The range of mechanical behaviors includes that of springs and brakes, with smooth transitions between them that allow for continuously variable power transmission by the vertebral column to assist in the mechanics of undulatory propulsion. Highlighted Article: Characterization of non-linear elasticity and viscosity throughout the bending oscillation reveals that the shark vertebral column behaves as both a spring and a brake, with smooth transitions between them for continuously variable power transmission.\",TRUE\nAvoidance and tolerance of freezing in ectothermic vertebrates,\"Summary Ectothermic vertebrates have colonized regions that are seasonally or perpetually cold, and some species, particularly terrestrial hibernators, must cope with temperatures that fall substantially below 0\u00ac\u221eC. Survival of such excursions depends on either freeze avoidance through supercooling or freeze tolerance. Supercooling, a metastable state in which body fluids remain liquid below the equilibrium freezing/melting point, is promoted by physiological responses that protect against chilling injury and by anatomical and behavioral traits that limit risk of inoculative freezing by environmental ice and ice-nucleating agents. Freeze tolerance evolved from responses to fundamental stresses to permit survival\n######################\noutput:"}}

Freeze tolerance evolved from responses to fundamental stresses to permit survival of the freezing of a substantial amount of body water under thermal and temporal conditions of ecological relevance. Survival of freezing is promoted by a complex suite of molecular, biochemical and physiological responses that limit cell death from excessive shrinkage, damage to macromolecules and membranes, metabolic perturbation and oxidative stress. Although freeze avoidance and freeze tolerance generally are mutually exclusive strategies, a few species can switch between them, the mode used in a particular instance of chilling depending on prevailing physiological and environmental conditions.\",TRUE\nAvoidance of Catastrophic Structural Failure as an Evolutionary Constraint: Biomechanics of the Acorn Weevil Rostrum.,\"The acorn weevil (Curculio Linnaeus, 1758) rostrum (snout) exhibits remarkable flexibility and toughness derived from the microarchitecture of its exoskeleton. Modifications to the composite profile of the rostral cuticle that simultaneously enhance the flexibility and toughness of the distal portion of the snout are characterized. Using classical laminate plate theory, the effect of these modifications on the elastic behavior of the exoskeleton is estimated. It is shown that the tensile behavior of the rostrum across six Curculio species with high morphological variation correlates with changes in the relative layer thicknesses and orientation angles of layers in the exoskeleton. Accordingly, increased endocuticle thickness is strongly correlated with increased tensile strength. Rostrum stiffness is shown to be inversely correlated with work of fracture; thus allowing a highly curved rostrum to completely straighten without structural damage. Finally, exocuticle rich invaginations of the occipital sutures are identified both as a likely site of crack initiation in tensile failure and as a source of morphological constraint on the evolution of the rostrum in Curculio weevils. It is concluded that avoidance of catastrophic structural failure, as initiated in these sutures under tension, is the driving selective pressure in the evolution of the female Curculio rostrum.\",TRUE\nB cell zone reticular cell microenvironments shape CXCL13 gradient formation,\"Through the formation of concentration gradients, morphogens drive graded responses to extracellular signals, thereby fine-tuning cell behaviors in complex tissues\n######################\noutput:"}}

The smallest discriminable change of source location was found to be about two times finer in azimuth than in elevation. Recordings from neurons in its midbrain space map revealed that their spatial tuning, like the spatial discrimination behavior, was also better in azimuth than in elevation by a factor of about two. Because the PDR behavioral assay is mediated by the same circuitry whether discrimination is assessed in azimuth or in elevation, this difference in vertical and horizontal acuity is likely to reflect a true difference in sensory resolution, without additional confounding effects of differences in motor performance in the two dimensions. Our results, therefore, are consistent with the hypothesis that the acuity of the midbrain space map determines auditory spatial discrimination.\",TRUE\nAutomatic control: the vertebral column of dogfish sharks behaves as a continuously variable transmission\n######################\noutput:"}}

Here, we used Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) as the alpha-coronavirus model, and investigated the antiviral properties of curcumin against TGEV. Our results demonstrated that curcumin strongly inhibited TGEV proliferation and viral protein expression in a dose-dependent manner. We also observed that curcumin exhibited direct virucidal abilities in a dose-, temperature- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, time-of-addition assays showed that curcumin mainly acted in the early phase of TGEV replication. Notably, in an adsorption assay, curcumin at 40\u201a\u00c4\u00e2\u00ac\u00b5M resulted in a reduction in viral titres of 3.55 log TCID50 ml-1, indicating that curcumin possesses excellent inhibitory effects on the adsorption of TGEV. Collectively, we demonstrate for the first time that curcumin has virucidal activity and virtual inhibition against TGEV, suggesting that curcumin might be a candidate drug for effective control of TGEV infection.\",TRUE\nAnts recognize foes and not friends,\"Discriminating among individuals and rejecting non-group members is essential for the evolution and stability of animal societies. Ants are good models for studying recognition mechanisms, because they are typically very efficient in discriminating \u201a\u00c4\u00f2friends\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 (nest-mates) from \u201a\u00c4\u00f2foes\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 (non-nest-mates). Recognition in ants involves multicomponent cues encoded in cuticular hydrocarbon profiles. Here, we tested whether workers of the carpenter ant Camponotus herculeanus use the presence and/or absence of cuticular hydrocarbons to discriminate between nest-mates and non-nest-mates. We supplemented the cuticular profile with synthetic hydrocarbons mixed to liquid food and then assessed behavioural responses using two different bioassays. Our results show that (i) the presence, but not the absence, of an additional hydrocarbon elicited aggression and that (ii) among the three classes of hydrocarbons tested (unbranched, mono-methylated and dimethylated alkanes; for mono-methylated alkanes, we present a new synthetic pathway), only the dimethylated alkane was effective in eliciting aggression\n######################\noutput:"}}

An anatomical interpretation of this mechanical movement was investigated.METHODSAn anatomical study of the stem was conducted on the juvenile plants raised under different water treatments and on the branch-orders of adult A. hierochuntica size-classes.KEY RESULTSIn the juvenile stem of A. hierochuntica, the area of cortex, conducting tissue and pith increased with water availability. However, the hydraulic conductance decreased, resulting in a better withdrawal of water in water-stressed plants. The anatomical investigation of the hygrochastic mechanism revealed an asymmetric distribution of the cortical tissues, with the conducting tissues of the stem of juvenile and adult plants being larger in the lower side. The hydraulic conductance was better in the basal and middle branch-orders than the terminal ones, permitting better conductance of water to the subsequent branch-orders.CONCLUSIONSThe lignified conducting tissue of the whole stem, having a hygrochastic nature, controls the movement of the branches. The greater amount of conducting tissue associated with a higher density of wide xylem vessels was observed in the lower side of the stem as compared with the upper side. Consequently, the conducting tissue in the lower side of the stem was suggested to be more effective in the opening process of the curled dry branches through better and more rapid conductance of water. Alternatively, due to the few narrow xylem vessels in the upper side of the stem, it was likely that the conducting tissue in the upper side is more effective in the closing process by providing more rapid drying. The mechanical rise of water and the related hygrochastic efficiency were maximized in the basal and middle branch-orders that are mostly involved in the mechanical movement.\",TRUE\nAnatomically diverse butterfly scales all produce structural colours by coherent scattering,\"SUMMARY The structural colours of butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) have been attributed to a diversity of physical mechanisms, including multilayer interference, diffraction, Bragg scattering, Tyndall scattering and Rayleigh scattering. We used fibre optic spectrophotometry, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and 2D Fourier analysis to investigate the physical mechanisms of structural colour production in twelve lepidopteran species from four families, representing all of the previously proposed anatomical and optical classes of butterfly nanostructure. The 2D Fourier analyses of TEMs of colour producing butterfly scales document that all species are appropriately nanostructured to produce visible colours by coherent scattering, i.e. differential interference and reinforcement of scattered, visible wavelengths.\n######################\noutput:"}}

An anatomical interpretation of this mechanical movement was investigated.METHODSAn anatomical study of the stem was conducted on the juvenile plants raised under different water treatments and on the branch-orders of adult A. hierochuntica size-classes.KEY RESULTSIn the juvenile stem of A. hierochuntica, the area of cortex, conducting tissue and pith increased with water availability. However, the hydraulic conductance decreased, resulting in a better withdrawal of water in water-stressed plants. The anatomical investigation of the hygrochastic mechanism revealed an asymmetric distribution of the cortical tissues, with the conducting tissues of the stem of juvenile and adult plants being larger in the lower side. The hydraulic conductance was better in the basal and middle branch-orders than the terminal ones, permitting better conductance of water to the subsequent branch-orders.CONCLUSIONSThe lignified conducting tissue of the whole stem, having a hygrochastic nature, controls the movement of the branches. The greater amount of conducting tissue associated with a higher density of wide xylem vessels was observed in the lower side of the stem as compared with the upper side. Consequently, the conducting tissue in the lower side of the stem was suggested to be more effective in the opening process of the curled dry branches through better and more rapid conductance of water. Alternatively, due to the few narrow xylem vessels in the upper side of the stem, it was likely that the conducting tissue in the upper side is more effective in the closing process by providing more rapid drying. The mechanical rise of water and the related hygrochastic efficiency were maximized in the basal and middle branch-orders that are mostly involved in the mechanical movement.\",TRUE\nAnatomically diverse butterfly scales all produce structural colours by coherent scattering,\"SUMMARY The structural colours of butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) have been attributed to a diversity of physical mechanisms, including multilayer interference, diffraction, Bragg scattering, Tyndall scattering and Rayleigh scattering.

During a tandem run, a single leader teaches one follower the route to important resources such as sources of food or better nest sites. In the present study, we investigate what tandem leaders and followers do, in the context of nest emigration, if their partner goes missing. Our experiments involved removing either leaders or followers at set points during tandem runs. Former leaders first stand still and wait for their missing follower but then most often proceed alone to the new nest site. By contrast, former followers often first engage in a Brownian search, for almost exactly the time that their former leader should have waited for them, and then former followers switch to a superdiffusive search. In this way, former followers first search their immediate neighbourhood for their lost leader before becoming ever more wide ranging so that in the absence of their former leader they can often find the new nest, re-encounter the old one or meet a new leader. We also show that followers gain useful information even from incomplete tandem runs.

During a tandem run, a single leader teaches one follower the route to important resources such as sources of food or better nest sites. In the present study, we investigate what tandem leaders and followers do, in the context of nest emigration, if their partner goes missing. Our experiments involved removing either leaders or followers at set points during tandem runs. Former leaders first stand still and wait for their missing follower but then most often proceed alone to the new nest site. By contrast, former followers often first engage in a Brownian search, for almost exactly the time that their former leader should have waited for them, and then former followers switch to a superdiffusive search. In this way, former followers first search their immediate neighbourhood for their lost leader before becoming ever more wide ranging so that in the absence of their former leader they can often find the new nest, re-encounter the old one or meet a new leader. We also show that followers gain useful information even from incomplete tandem runs. These observations point to the important principle that sophisticated communication behaviours may have evolved as anytime algorithms, i.e. procedures that are beneficial even if they do not run to completion.\",TRUE\nAnt semiochemicals limit apterous aphid dispersal,\"Some organisms can manipulate the nervous systems of others or alter their physiology in order to obtain benefit.

How the ordered structure of aragonite layers is achieved has been unclear. Suzuki et al. (p. 1388, published online 13 August 2009; see the Perspective by Kr\u221a\u2202ger) identified two acidic matrix proteins (Pif 97 and Pif 80) that regulate nacre formation in the Japanese pearl oyster. The proteins appear to form a complex in which Pif 80 binds to aragonite and Pif 97 binds to other macromolecules in the organic matrix. A matrix protein is identified that regulates nacre formation in the Japanese pearl oyster. The mollusk shell is a hard tissue consisting of calcium carbonate crystals and an organic matrix. The nacre of the shell is characterized by a stacked compartment structure with a uniformly oriented c axis of aragonite crystals in each compartment. Using a calcium carbonate\u201a\u00c4\u00ecbinding assay, we identified an acidic matrix protein, Pif, in the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata that specifically binds to aragonite crystals. The Pif complementary DNA (cDNA) encoded a precursor protein, which was posttranslationally cleaved to produce Pif 97 and Pif 80. The results from immunolocalization, a knockdown experiment that used RNA interference, and in vitro calcium carbonate crystallization studies strongly indicate that Pif regulates nacre formation.\",TRUE\nAn exceptionally fast actomyosin reaction powers insect flight muscle,\"Insects, as a group, have been remarkably successful in adapting to a great range of physical and biological environments, in large part because of their ability to fly.

At the cellular and protein filament level, a stretch activation mechanism evolved that allowed high-oscillatory work to be achieved at very high frequencies as contraction and nerve stimulus became asynchronous. At the molecular level, critical adaptations occurred within the motor protein myosin II, because its elementary interactions with actin set the speed of sarcomere contraction.

This makes the lipid layers more ordered and creates a tighter barrier against water vapor diffusion, reducing water loss.\n\n2. **Mountain Pine Beetle Flight and Host Colonization**\n   - Female mountain pine beetles that fly longer distances and lose more body mass during flight are less likely to colonize new hosts (trees) but produce more aggregation pheromone.\n   - Male beetles' production of attraction pheromone is affected by their condition after flying, not the energy used during flight.\n   - This variation in flight behavior helps maintain population levels by balancing safe and risky host colonization strategies.\n\n3. **Piezoelectric Scaffold for Adaptive Bone Tissue Engineering**\n   - A new material system is developed that can adapt its mechanical properties in response to external stress.\n   - Piezoelectric scaffolds generate charges when stressed, which induce mineralization from surrounding media, reinforcing regions of high stress or damaged areas.\n   - This self-regenerating material could help address challenges in load-bearing applications by adapting to changing stress conditions.\n\n4. **Daily Variation of UV-Protective Compounds in Marine Dinoflagellate**\n   - The marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae increases its production of UV-absorbing compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids) when exposed to high photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) or PAR plus ultraviolet radiation (UVR).\n   - These compounds help protect the dinoflagellate from UV damage.\n\n5. **Termite Mounds as Passive Ventilation Systems**\n   - Termite mounds in different environments use periodic solar heating to drive internal ventilation, functioning like an external lung for the colony.\n   - Despite differences in gas stratification and overturning patterns, termite architectures can harness solar energy to facilitate gas exchange, with implications for human engineering. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

Despite the ubiquity of this type of coloration, neither the relative contribution of structures and pigments to variation in such colour displays nor the relative effects of extrinsic factors on the structural and pigment-based components of such colour has been determined. Understanding the sources of colour variation is important because structures and pigments may convey different information to conspecifics. In an experiment on captive American goldfinches Carduelis tristis, we manipulated two parameters, carotenoid availability and food availability, known to affect the expression of carotenoid pigments in a full-factorial design. Yellow feathers from these birds were then analysed in two ways. First, we used full-spectrum spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography to examine the extent to which variation in white structural colour and total carotenoid content was associated with variation in colour properties of feathers. The carotenoid content of yellow feathers predicted two colour parameters (principal component 1\u201a\u00c4\u00eerepresenting high values of ultraviolet and yellow chroma and low values of violet\u201a\u00c4\u00ecblue chroma\u201a\u00c4\u00eeand hue). Two different colour parameters (violet\u201a\u00c4\u00ecblue and yellow chroma) from white de-pigmented feathers, as well as carotenoid content, predicted reflectance measurements from yellow feathers. Second, we determined the relative effects of our experimental manipulations on white structural colour and yellow colour. Carotenoid availability directly affected yellow colour, while food availability affected it only in combination with carotenoid availability. None of our manipulations had significant effects on the expression of white structural colour. Our results suggest that the contribution of microstructures to variation in the expression of yellow coloration is less than the contribution of carotenoid content, and that carotenoid deposition is more dependent on extrinsic variability than is the production of white structural colour.\",TRUE\nAn insect trap as habitat: cohesion-failure mechanism prevents adhesion of Pameridea roridulae bugs to the sticky surface of the plant Roridula gorgonias,\"SUMMARY The glandular trichomes of the plant Roridula gorgonias release an extremely adhesive, visco-elastic, resinous secretion that traps a variety of insects, including those having a considerable body size.

They were widely reported to reduce the reflectance for normally incident light, contributing to camouflage by reducing glare to predators, while furthermore enhancing the intake of light, which is especially important for nocturnal insects. Our preliminary observations suggest a third function: in contrast to the rest of the body, ommatidia of various insects remain clean, even in a heavy contaminated environment. In order to prove such an anti-contamination hypothesis of these structures, we measured the adhesive properties of polymer moulds of insect ommatidia, and compared these data with control surfaces having the same curvature radii but lacking such a nanostructure. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) study and force measurements using an atomic force microscope (AFM) on the eye surfaces of three different insect species, dragonfly Aeshna mixta (Odonata), moth Laothoe populi (Lepidoptera) and fly Volucella pellucens (Diptera), were undertaken. We revealed that adhesion is greatly reduced by corneal grating in L. populi and V. pellucens when compared with their smooth controls.

They were widely reported to reduce the reflectance for normally incident light, contributing to camouflage by reducing glare to predators, while furthermore enhancing the intake of light, which is especially important for nocturnal insects. Our preliminary observations suggest a third function: in contrast to the rest of the body, ommatidia of various insects remain clean, even in a heavy contaminated environment. In order to prove such an anti-contamination hypothesis of these structures, we measured the adhesive properties of polymer moulds of insect ommatidia, and compared these data with control surfaces having the same curvature radii but lacking such a nanostructure. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) study and force measurements using an atomic force microscope (AFM) on the eye surfaces of three different insect species, dragonfly Aeshna mixta (Odonata), moth Laothoe populi (Lepidoptera) and fly Volucella pellucens (Diptera), were undertaken. We revealed that adhesion is greatly reduced by corneal grating in L. populi and V. pellucens when compared with their smooth controls. The smooth cornea of A. mixta showed no statistically significant difference to its control. We assume that this anti-adhesive phenomenon is due to a decrease in the real contact area between contaminating particles and the eye's surface.

This makes the lipid layers more ordered and creates a tighter barrier against water vapor diffusion, reducing water loss.\n\n2. **Mountain Pine Beetle Flight and Host Colonization**\n   - Female mountain pine beetles that fly longer distances and lose more body mass during flight are less likely to colonize new hosts (trees) but produce more aggregation pheromone.\n   - Male beetles' production of attraction pheromone is affected by their condition after flying, not the energy used during flight.\n   - This variation in flight behavior helps maintain population levels by balancing safe and risky host colonization strategies.\n\n3. **Piezoelectric Scaffold for Adaptive Bone Tissue Engineering**\n   - A new material system is developed that can adapt its mechanical properties in response to external stress.\n   - Piezoelectric scaffolds generate charges when stressed, which induce mineralization from surrounding media, reinforcing regions of high stress or damaged areas.\n   - This self-regenerating material could help address challenges in load-bearing applications by adapting to changing stress conditions.\n\n4. **Daily Variation of UV-Protective Compounds in Marine Dinoflagellate**\n   - The marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae increases its production of UV-absorbing compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids) when exposed to high photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) or PAR plus ultraviolet radiation (UVR).\n   - These compounds help protect the dinoflagellate from UV damage.\n\n5. **Termite Mounds as Passive Ventilation Systems**\n   - Termite mounds in different environments use periodic solar heating to drive internal ventilation, functioning like an external lung for the colony.\n   - Despite differences in gas stratification and overturning patterns, termite architectures can harness solar energy to facilitate gas exchange, with implications for human engineering. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

This paper reviews the mechanisms arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi employ to enhance the salt tolerance of host plants such as enhanced nutrient acquisition (P, N, Mg and Ca), maintenance of the K(+) : Na(+) ratio, biochemical changes (accumulation of proline, betaines, polyamines, carbohydrates and antioxidants), physiological changes (photosynthetic efficiency, relative permeability, water status, abscissic acid accumulation, nodulation and nitrogen fixation), molecular changes (the expression of genes: PIP, Na(+)/H(+) antiporters, Lsnced, Lslea and LsP5CS) and ultra-structural changes. Theis review identifies certain lesser explored areas such as molecular and ultra-structural changes where further research is needed for better understanding of symbiosis with reference to salt stress for optimum usage of this technology in the field on a large scale. This review paper gives useful benchmark information for the development and prioritization of future research programmes.\",TRUE\nArbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis modulates antioxidant response in salt-stressed Trigonella foenum-graecum plants,\"An experiment was conducted to evaluate the influence of Glomus intraradices colonization on the activity of antioxidant enzymes [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (PX), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and glutathione reductase (GR)] and the accumulation of nonenzymatic antioxidants (ascorbic acid, \u0152\u00b1-tocopherol, glutathione, and carotenoids) in roots and leaves of fenugreek plants subjected to varying degrees of salinity (0, 50, 100, and 200\u00ac\u2020mM NaCl) at two time intervals (1 and 14\u00ac\u2020days after saline treatment, DAT). The antioxidative capacity was correlated with oxidative damage in the same tissue. Under salt stress, lipid peroxidation and H2O2 concentration increased with increasing severity and duration of salt stress (DoS). However, the extent of oxidative damage in mycorrhizal plants was less compared to nonmycorrhizal plants. The study reveals that mycorrhiza-mediated attenuation of oxidative stress in fenugreek plants is due to enhanced activity of antioxidant enzymes and higher concentrations of antioxidant molecules.

Here, the three-dimensional NMR structure of the 36-amino acid NCR044 peptide was solved. This unique structure was largely disordered and highly dynamic with one four-residue \u0152\u00b1-helix and one three-residue antiparallel \u0152\u2264-sheet stabilized by two disulfide bonds. NCR044 peptide also exhibited potent fungicidal activity against multiple plant fungal pathogens, including Botrytis cinerea and three Fusarium spp. It inhibited germination in quiescent spores of B. cinerea. In germlings, it breached the fungal plasma membrane and induced reactive oxygen species. It bound to multiple bioactive phosphoinositides in vitro. Time-lapse confocal and superresolution microscopy revealed strong fungal cell wall binding, penetration of the cell membrane at discrete foci, followed by gradual loss of turgor, subsequent accumulation in the cytoplasm, and elevated levels in nucleoli of germlings. Spray-applied NCR044 significantly reduced gray mold disease symptoms caused by the fungal pathogen B. cinerea in tomato and tobacco plants, and postharvest products. Our work illustrates the antifungal activity of a structurally unique NCR peptide against plant fungal pathogens and paves the way for future development of this class of peptides as a spray-on fungistat/fungicide.\",TRUE\n\"Antimicrobial secretions and social immunity in larval burying beetles, Nicrophorus vespilloides\",\"Offspring of many animals develop in environments in which they are exposed to high densities of potentially harmful bacteria. For example, larvae of the carrion beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides face significant challenges from the bacteria they encounter during their development on decomposing vertebrate carcasses. We tested the idea that larvae secrete antimicrobial compounds during development to defend themselves against microbial exposure. We first showed that larval secretion of active antimicrobials peaked during the early stages of development. As has been found previously for parental secretions, larval secretions were active against Gram-positive but not Gram-negative bacteria, indicating that they might be based on lysozyme-like compounds. Finally, consistent with this antibacterial activity, we showed that larval survival declined significantly when challenged with lysozyme-resistant Staphylococcus aureus but not when challenged with a lysozyme-susceptible strain of the same species.

For the first time in the biomechanics of fish vertebral columns, we simultaneously characterized non-linear elasticity and viscosity throughout the bending oscillation, extending recently proposed techniques for large-amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) characterization to large-amplitude oscillatory bending (LAOB). The vertebral column segments behave as non-linear viscoelastic springs. Elastic properties dominate for all frequencies and curvatures tested, increasing as either variable increases. Non-linearities within a bending cycle are most in evidence at the highest frequency, 2.0\u201a\u00c4\u00d6Hz, and curvature, 5\u201a\u00c4\u00d6m\u201a\u00e0\u00ed1. Viscous bending properties are greatest at low frequencies and high curvatures, with non-linear effects occurring at all frequencies and curvatures. The range of mechanical behaviors includes that of springs and brakes, with smooth transitions between them that allow for continuously variable power transmission by the vertebral column to assist in the mechanics of undulatory propulsion. Highlighted Article: Characterization of non-linear elasticity and viscosity throughout the bending oscillation reveals that the shark vertebral column behaves as both a spring and a brake, with smooth transitions between them for continuously variable power transmission.\",TRUE\nAvoidance and tolerance of freezing in ectothermic vertebrates,\"Summary Ectothermic vertebrates have colonized regions that are seasonally or perpetually cold, and some species, particularly terrestrial hibernators, must cope with temperatures that fall substantially below 0\u00ac\u221eC. Survival of such excursions depends on either freeze avoidance through supercooling or freeze tolerance. Supercooling, a metastable state in which body fluids remain liquid below the equilibrium freezing/melting point, is promoted by physiological responses that protect against chilling injury and by anatomical and behavioral traits that limit risk of inoculative freezing by environmental ice and ice-nucleating agents. Freeze tolerance evolved from responses to fundamental stresses to permit survival\n######################\noutput:"}}

Two categories of pigments, flavonoids and dearomatized isoprenylated phloroglucinols (DIPs), are responsible for the UV demarcations of this flower. Flavonoids had been shown previously to function as floral UV pigments, but DIPs had not been demonstrated to serve in that capacity. We found the DIPs to be present in high concentration in the anthers and ovarian wall of the flower, suggesting that the compounds also serve in defense. Indeed, feeding tests done with one of the DIPs (hypercalin A) showed the compound to be deterrent and toxic to a caterpillar (Utetheisa ornatrix). The possibility that floral UV pigments fulfill both a visual and a defensive function had not previously been contemplated. DIPs may also serve for protection of female reproductive structures in other plants, for example in hops (Humulus lupulus). The DIPs of hops are put to human use as bitter flavoring agents and preservatives in beer.\",TRUE\nAuditory Spatial Acuity Approximates the Resolving Power of Space-Specific Neurons,\"The relationship between neuronal acuity and behavioral performance was assessed in the barn owl (Tyto alba), a nocturnal raptor renowned for its ability to localize sounds and for the topographic representation of auditory space found in the midbrain. We measured discrimination of sound-source separation using a newly developed procedure involving the habituation and recovery of the pupillary dilation response. The smallest discriminable change of source location was found to be about two times finer in azimuth than in elevation. Recordings from neurons in its midbrain space map revealed that their spatial tuning, like the spatial discrimination behavior, was also better in azimuth than in elevation by a factor of about two. Because the PDR behavioral assay is mediated by the same circuitry whether discrimination is assessed in azimuth or in elevation, this difference in vertical and horizontal acuity is likely to reflect a true difference in sensory resolution, without additional confounding effects of differences in motor performance in the two dimensions. Our results, therefore, are consistent with the hypothesis that the acuity of the midbrain space map determines auditory spatial discrimination.\",TRUE\nAutomatic control: the vertebral column of dogfish sharks behaves as a continuously variable transmission\n######################\noutput:"}}

The phytotoxicity of m-tyrosine was not influenced significantly by soil N amendment; however, when significant amounts of activated carbon were added to the soil medium, growth inhibition in treated lettuce seedlings was strongly reduced. Soil texture did not influence the bioavailability or activity of m-tyrosine, as activity in high organic growth media was similar to that of sand and soil mixtures. Similar to other purported allelochemicals, soil persistence of m-tyrosine was limited, with a predicted half life of less than 1\u00ac\u2020day in soil in a controlled laboratory setting. Rapid degradation of this molecule likely was due to microbial activity but degradation did not appear to be influenced significantly by soil N amendment. Given the observed activity of m-tyrosine in soil and growth media on seedling growth, potential may exist for development of m-tyrosine as a soil applied herbicide if formulations can be stabilized under soil conditions.\",TRUE\n\"Attachment to challenging substrates \u201a\u00c4\u00ec fouling, roughness and limits of adhesion in the northern clingfish (Gobiesox maeandricus)\",\"Northern clingfish use a ventral suction disc to stick to rough substrates in the intertidal zone. Bacteria, algae and invertebrates grow on these surfaces (fouling) and change the surface properties of the primary substrate, and therefore the attachment conditions for benthic organisms. In this study, we investigate the influence of fouling and surface roughness on the adhesive strength of northern clingfish, Gobiesox maeandricus. We measured clingfish tenacity on unfouled and fouled substrates over four surface roughnesses. We exposed surfaces for 6 weeks in the Pacific Ocean, until they were covered with periphyton. Clingfish tenacity is equivalent on both fouled and unfouled smooth substrates; however, tenacity on fouled rough surfaces is less compared with tenacity on unfouled ones. We hypothesize that parts of biofilm may act as a lubricant and decrease friction of the disc margin, thereby making disc margins slip inwards and fail at lower tenacities. Nevertheless, even on fouled surfaces the adhesive forces are approximately 150 times the body weight of the fish. To identify the upper threshold of surface roughness the fish can cling\n######################\noutput:"}}

Return output in Here's a simplified summary of each text in plain language:\n\n1. **Bird Skin Lipids Adaptation to Desert Environments**\n   - Larks living in hot, dry deserts have less water loss from their skin compared to those in more humid environments.\n   - Instead of having more lipids in their skin (stratum corneum), desert larks have a higher proportion of certain ceramides and fewer free fatty acids. This makes the lipid layers more ordered and creates a tighter barrier against water vapor diffusion, reducing water loss.\n\n2. **Mountain Pine Beetle Flight and Host Colonization**\n   - Female mountain pine beetles that fly longer distances and lose more body mass during flight are less likely to colonize new hosts (trees) but produce more aggregation pheromone.\n   - Male beetles' production of attraction pheromone is affected by their condition after flying, not the energy used during flight.\n   - This variation in flight behavior helps maintain population levels by balancing safe and risky host colonization strategies.\n\n3. **Piezoelectric Scaffold for Adaptive Bone Tissue Engineering**\n   - A new material system is developed that can adapt its mechanical properties in response to external stress.\n   - Piezoelectric scaffolds generate charges when stressed, which induce mineralization from surrounding media, reinforcing regions of high stress or damaged areas.\n   - This self-regenerating material could help address challenges in load-bearing applications by adapting to changing stress conditions.\n\n4. **Daily Variation of UV-Protective Compounds in Marine Dinoflagellate**\n   - The marine dinoflagellate Scrippsiella sweeneyae increases its production of UV-absorbing compounds (mycosporine-like amino acids) when exposed to high photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) or PAR plus ultraviolet radiation (UVR).\n   - These compounds help protect the dinoflagellate from UV damage.\n\n5. **Termite Mounds as Passive Ventilation Systems**\n   - Termite mounds in different environments use periodic solar heating to drive internal ventilation, functioning like an external lung for the colony.\n   - Despite differences in gas stratification and overturning patterns, termite architectures can harness solar energy to facilitate gas exchange, with implications for human engineering. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

Cellulose fibers are formed from close-packed single chains of cellulose that have been proposed to be formed by multimeric complexes (18 or more subunits) of the enzyme cellulose synthase, which exists in several isoforms. Purushotham et al. determined a cryo\u201a\u00c4\u00ecelectron microscopy structure of a trimer of a single isoform of cellulose synthase. A large channel forms a path for cellulose chains through the membrane-embedded complex. The structure also reveals oligomeric interfaces and provides a framework for modeling the larger complexes seen in plant membranes. The close arrangement of exit sites for nascent glycan chains is consistent with the enzyme complex playing a role in directing cellulose microfibril formation. Science, this issue p. 1089 The structure of a homotrimeric cellulose synthase complex provides molecular insights into cellulose fibril formation. Cellulose is an essential plant cell wall component and represents the most abundant biopolymer on Earth. Supramolecular plant cellulose synthase complexes organize multiple linear glucose polymers into microfibrils as load-bearing wall components. We determined the structure of a poplar cellulose synthase CesA homotrimer that suggests a molecular basis for cellulose microfibril formation. This complex, stabilized by cytosolic plant-conserved regions and helical exchange within the transmembrane segments, forms three channels occupied by nascent cellulose polymers. Secretion steers the polymers toward a common exit point, which could facilitate protofibril formation. CesA\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s N-terminal domains assemble into a cytosolic stalk that interacts with a microtubule-tethering protein and may thus be involved in CesA localization. Our data suggest how cellulose synthase complexes assemble and provide the molecular basis for plant cell wall engineering.\",TRUE\nArtificial Muscle Begins to Breathe,\"In robots, the power source is usually distant from the actual moving parts, which can be inefficient.
